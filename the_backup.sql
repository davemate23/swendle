ST. LOUIS (AP) - Randal Grichuk homered in his return to the majors, Yadier Molina had three hits and the St. Louis Cardinals beat the Pittsburgh Pirates 8-4 on Sunday night.\n\nGrichuk, who was sent to the minors on May 29 after struggling with consistency, had two hits - including his solo homer in the sixth inning - and scored twice. Molina, who had missed the previous two games after being hit by a foul tip on the knee, had three hits, scored three runs and drove in a run.\n\nThe Cardinals, who had lost three straight, scored four runs in the seventh to break open a tie game. Molina’s RBI single off Juan Nicasio (1-4) made it 5-4 and rookie Paul DeJong’s two-run single gave St. Louis an 8-4 lead.\n\nTrevor Rosenthal (2-3) struck out the only batter he faced in the seventh to earn the win in relief for the Cardinals. Starter Mike Leake went six innings and allowed four runs - three earned - and six hits in six innings.\n\nSt. Louis took a 2-0 lead in the second on Greg Garcia’s two-run single, but the Pirates went up 3-2 in the third on Adam Frazier’s two-run triple and Josh Harrison’s sacrifice fly.\n\nPittsburgh added another run in the fourth on Elias Diaz’s sacrifice fly that scored Andrew McCutchen.\n\nThe Cardinals tied the game in the sixth on Grichuk’s homer off Pirates starter Chad Kuhl and Jedd Gyorko’s pinch-hit ground-rule RBI double. Grichuk’s 478-foot homer was the longest by a Cardinals player in the new Busch Stadium and the second-longest in stadium history. Milwaukee’s Keon Broxton crushed a 489-foot shot on June 15.\n\nKuhl gave up four runs and eight hits in five innings. He struck out six and walked one.\n\nROSTER SHUFFLE\n\nThe Cardinals placed OF Dexter Fowler (right heel spur) and LHP Kevin Siegrist (cervical spine sprain) on the disabled list and optioned OF Chad Huffman to Triple-A Memphis before the game. St. Louis recalled Grichuk and RHP Mike Mayers and purchased the contract of 1B Luke Voit from Triple-A.\n\nMAJOR LEAGUE DEBUT\n\nVoit, who grew up in the St. Louis suburb of Wildwood, Missouri, pinch hit for the Cardinals in the seventh inning for his first major league plate appearance. He was hit in the back by a 96 mph fastball from Jhan Marinez.\n\nVoit is from the same high school - Lafayette - as former National League MVP Ryan Howard and former World Series MVP David Freese. Freese, who was playing third base for the Pirates on Sunday night, sent Voit a congratulatory note before the game.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPirates: After an off day Monday, RHP Trevor Williams (3-3, 5.09) will make his 10th start of the season on Tuesday night against visiting Tampa Bay.\n\nCardinals: RHP Michael Wacha (3-3, 4.76) will face the Reds in a makeup game against visiting Cincinnati on Monday afternoon. He is 7-1 with a 2.95 ERA in 13 career starts (15 appearances) against Cincinnati.\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	2017-06-26 07:33:00.432579+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	6	690	['The Washington Times Http', 'Nate Latsch']

1065	Westbrook set to learn if his historic season was an MVP one		http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2017/06/26/nba_awards_mvp_finalists_basketball_16313.jpg	http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jun/26/westbrook-set-to-learn-if-his-historic-season-was-/?utm_source=RSS_Feed&amp;utm_medium=RSS	\N	Westbrook had played his entire NBA career alongside Durant, so questions about how Westbrook would respond immediately cropped up.\nWestbrook became the first player since Oscar Robertson in 1961-62 to average a triple-double for a season and won his second scoring title.\nNow, he will join Houston’s James Harden and San Antonio’s Kawhi Leonard as finalists for the league’s MVP award.\nWestbrook topped Robertson’s single-season, triple-double record on April 9 in Denver.\nHe hit a deep 3-pointer to force overtime, and eventually helped the Thunder win.	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) - A year ago, uncertainty surrounded Russell Westbrook.\n\nKevin Durant stunned the league by leaving Oklahoma City for rival Golden State in free agency. The four-time scoring champion and former MVP had been the central piece in making the Thunder one of the league’s elite teams since the franchise’s move to Oklahoma City in 2008.\n\nWestbrook had played his entire NBA career alongside Durant, so questions about how Westbrook would respond immediately cropped up.\n\nHe defiantly answered them with memorable performances.\n\nWestbrook became the first player since Oscar Robertson in 1961-62 to average a triple-double for a season and won his second scoring title. He broke Robertson’s single-season record with 42 triple-doubles and led the Thunder to the playoffs. Now, he will join Houston’s James Harden and San Antonio’s Kawhi Leonard as finalists for the league’s MVP award. The winner will be announced Monday at the inaugural NBA Awards show.\n\nWestbrook gained satisfaction from the team’s success, which largely was fueled by his personal dominance.\n\n“With everything happening last summer, people counted us out,” he said the day after Oklahoma City’s season ended. “They weren’t sure how many games we were going to win or how far we were going to go or whatever, but I think the group of guys, we never let that sink in our building. We stuck together, and that’s the thing I’m most proud about.”\n\nWestbrook wasn’t just stat stuffing, either. The Thunder went 33-9 when he had a triple-double and 14-26 when he didn’t. He seemingly gained energy as the season progressed and was statistically better after the All-Star break than before. As for those late-game situations, he led the league with 10 points per game in the fourth quarter and was one of the most dynamic closers in the league.\n\nWestbrook topped Robertson’s single-season, triple-double record on April 9 in Denver. His 36-foot game-winning dagger put the final touch on a 50-point, 16-rebound, 10-assist performance that eliminated the Nuggets from playoff contention.\n\nRobertson himself showed up to the Thunder’s regular-season finale and endorsed Westbrook for the MVP award.\n\n“What he has done has been historic in nature,” Robertson told the crowd that night. “He’s played with passion and pride and ability. It’s just outstanding what he has done and the way he did it.”\n\nDurant might be the least surprised player in the league. Westbrook was dominant while Durant was out with a foot injury during the 2014-15 season and claimed his first scoring title, but it wasn’t clear if he could do it all - score, dominate the boards, consistently feed his teammates and come through in big moments - for an entire season.\n\nTurns out, he could.\n\nIn the second game of the season, he had 51 points, 13 rebounds and 10 assists in a victory over Phoenix, the first 50-point triple-double since Kareem Abdul-Jabbar did it in 1975. On March 27, he had 13 points in a 3-minute barrage to rally the Thunder past Dallas. Two days later in Orlando, he scored 57 points and posted the most points ever in a triple-double. He hit a deep 3-pointer to force overtime, and eventually helped the Thunder win. In one of his most memorable games, he scored 47 points in a loss to Durant’s Warriors.\n\nHarden and Leonard also had MVP-caliber seasons:\n\n_____\n\nJAMES HARDEN, HOUSTON\n\nAs stunning as Westbrook’s triple-double binge was this season, Harden’s was impressive, too.\n\nHe posted 22 triple-doubles and helped the Rockets finish with the league’s third-best record. Harden, known primarily as a scorer throughout his career, shifted from shooting guard to point guard and was nearly unstoppable in coach Mike D’Antoni’s fast-paced offense.\n\nHarden led the league with 11.2 assists per game and finished second with 29.1 points per contest. In perhaps his best performance, he had 53 points, 16 rebounds and 17 assists against the New York Knicks on New Year’s Eve.\n\n___\n\nKAWHI LEONARD, SAN ANTONIO\n\nLeonard is the two-time reigning Defensive Player of the Year, and he’s up for the honor again.\n\nYet, it was the 6-foot-7 forward’s offensive improvement that put him in the mix for the MVP award. He averaged 25.5 points this season after averaging 21.2 the previous year.\n\nLeonard helped the Spurs finish with the league’s second-best record. He seemed to play as the stage got bigger.\n\nHe opened the season with a career-high 35 points in a blowout win over the Warriors. Leonard upped that career high with 41 points in a win over Cleveland on Jan. 21, and he dropped 39 points in a victory over Houston on March 6.\n\n___\n\nFollow Cliff Brunt on Twitter: www.twitter.com/CliffBruntAP .	2017-06-26 11:37:21.918904+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	6	710	['The Washington Times Http', 'Cliff Brunt']
1066	Refugee family opens up on coming to Oklahoma			http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jun/26/refugee-family-opens-up-on-coming-to-oklahoma/	\N	Soccer games have become a beloved part of the family’s busy schedule since coming to the United States nearly five years ago.\nAt a time when President Donald Trump is seeking to suspend refugee admissions to the country, they are grateful to call the United States home.\n“Especially being here now.”The United States is a country of freedom and opportunities, she said, where hard work is rewarded.\nShe was decorating her classroom when she and Estabraq got word their family could come to the United States.\nRefugees who settle here are protective of the United States, Nassil said.	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) - Nassil Abdullah galloped sideways, her sneakers toeing the faded blue boundary line of the soccer field.\n\n“Go! Go! Go!” she screamed, her cries cutting through the noise of several youth soccer games on a cloudless Saturday morning at Merrel Medley Park in south Oklahoma City.\n\nA few paces away, wearing a green T-shirt with the word “COACH” printed across the back in thick, white letters, her husband Estabraq Al-Adhami picked key moments to call out to his players, his calm composure a contrast to his wife’s unbridled enthusiasm.\n\nThe couple’s older daughter, Hala, 9, was playing in the final game of the season with her YMCA team, the Stars. Nearby, their other daughter, Lamar, 6, and a friend pushed a pink plastic Jeep across empty bleachers, oblivious to the on-field action.\n\nSoccer games have become a beloved part of the family’s busy schedule since coming to the United States nearly five years ago.\n\nThe Oklahoman (http://bit.ly/2sTqGZO ) reports that Estabraq, 46, an Iraqi, and Nassil, 37, a Palestinian, arrived in Oklahoma from Lebanon in September 2012 with their two young daughters, determined to forge a brighter future for their family. Like many other refugees resettled in the United States, their family’s journey to get to this point was long and difficult, at times solitary, and filled with sacrifices and challenges. But it has been worth it, the couple said.\n\nAt a time when President Donald Trump is seeking to suspend refugee admissions to the country, they are grateful to call the United States home.\n\n“We’re just trying to take advantage of every single minute because we really appreciate everything,” Nassil said.\n\nMany refugees now living in the Oklahoma City area feel uneasy in the wake of President Trump’s executive order that, in part, seeks a 120-day suspension of refugee admissions. Even though the courts have blocked the ban from taking effect, many were unwilling to share their stories, worried about possible repercussions.\n\nNassil hopes that talking about her family’s experiences will help combat misconceptions and give people a “real impression” of who refugees are.\n\n“We are normal people,” Nassil said on a recent weekday evening, wearing a tank top that read “Running Late is My Cardio.”\n\nHer husband, just home from his job as a lead maintenance worker at the Oklahoma County Juvenile Bureau and still in his work uniform, added, “We work hard for our life.”\n\nBetween Jan. 1, 2007, and Dec. 31, 2016, Oklahoma took in 3,047 refugees from 20 countries, according U.S. State Department. The vast majority - 2,404 - were from Myanmar, followed by Iraq (279), Eritrea (84), Somalia (36), and Ukraine (36).\n\nOf those, about 1,300, from 14 different countries, were settled in Oklahoma City, with assistance from Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of Oklahoma City.\n\nNassil is thankful that their girls are growing up in a country where their cares center on things like school and what they’re going to wear and what sport they’re going to play - unlike the thoughts of children in war-torn countries who worry about survival and for whom sleeping is a privilege. She and Estabraq don’t like to think about the tumultuous environment or the hardships they left behind.\n\n“We’re lucky to be able to forget,” Nassil said.\n\nSeated on a brown, L-shaped couch in her family’s living room, Nassil spread out a stack of her daughters’ scholastic awards - everything from a trophy for outstanding citizenship to certificates for reading 169 library books and making the honor roll.\n\nLike any proud parent, Nassil beams about her daughters’ accomplishments. She and her husband focus so much on education, she said, because they believe that’s what takes people places.\n\n“If they are educated, I don’t think anything will stop them,” Nassil said of the girls. “Especially being here now.”\n\nThe United States is a country of freedom and opportunities, she said, where hard work is rewarded.\n\n“Unfortunately, in our countries now, it reached a point where no matter what you do, there’s no improvement,” Nassil said of her home country. “You can’t do anything. You can’t progress. You can’t have a future for your kids.”\n\nIn May 2008, a brief period of gun battles between Hezbollah supporters and government supporters broke out in the streets of Beirut. Snipers roamed the rooftops around Nassil and Estabraq’s home. Nearly nine months pregnant, Nassil dragged her mattress into an interior hallway, away from the windows. She thought she’d be safest there.\n\nShe slept in her clothes, not knowing when she might need to run. She prayed nothing would go wrong with her pregnancy because she didn’t know how she would get to a hospital. The day after hearing news of a truce, Nassil’s water broke. She delivered Hala several weeks early, she believes, because of stress caused by the violence and turmoil.\n\nNassil said the family’s last couple of years in Lebanon were like living near a volcano ready to explode, with occasional gunfire, school lockdowns and heavily armed civilians who would sometimes stop people in the streets and demand to see identification.\n\nNassil and her husband were used to living in that type of environment. She remembered taking shelter as a child in the basement of the building where her family lived during the Lebanese Civil War, which spanned 15 years and resulted in an estimated 150,000 deaths. To this day, thunder wakes her because the sound reminds her of the bombs she used to hear.\n\nNassil and Estabraq wanted a different life for their daughters.\n\n“No matter where you live in the Middle East, all Middle Eastern kids live through war and know what war is,” Nassil said. “There’s no safety.”\n\nEstabraq fled Iraq in the late-1990s when he was in his 20s. He declined to discuss the details surrounding his departure, citing concerns for family who still live there.\n\nHe applied for refugee status in Lebanon. Estabraq paid about $1,000 a year for a permanent residence card and had to have someone who was Lebanese sponsor him. Often, people were sponsored by their employer and worried they could lose their sponsorship at a moment’s notice should their employer have no more use for them.\n\nAs a Palestinian in Lebanon, Nassil faced her own challenges. Despite being born in the country, she was denied employment opportunities because of her Palestinian nationality. Lebanon bars Palestinians from working in a number of professions.\n\n“I reached a point that before I (would) go apply to a job, I would call and ask, ‘Is it OK if I’m Palestinian?’ as if it’s a disease because I got turned down so many times,” Nassil said.\n\nShe managed to get a teaching job at a school desperate to fill a mid-year opening. The school’s principal watched Nassil teach a lesson as part of the interview process. Afterward, Nassil overheard the principal on the phone saying, ‘What can I do? That’s the only person I found that the kids loved, and she did a great job.’ “\n\nThe school gave Nassil a shot, and she went on to be named Teacher of the Year. She was decorating her classroom when she and Estabraq got word their family could come to the United States.\n\nNearly 15 years had passed since Estabraq first applied for refugee status. The family had just 15 days to pack - allowed to bring just eight suitcases among the four of them.\n\nA U.S. Embassy official had warned the couple that nothing was official until their feet touched American soil. Estabraq spent the entire 26-hour journey - from Lebanon to London to Chicago to Oklahoma City - worried it could all be taken away.\n\nBefore coming to the U.S., the family went through background checks, health screenings and at least 10 interviews, each time taking a day off work and bringing their young daughters for the all-day affair.\n\nOfficials would never tell them the status of their case. They had to keep their phones nearby at all times because if an official called them about making an appointment and they missed the call, they would miss their opportunity.\n\nSometimes months would pass with no updates and no movement in their case.\n\nThe wait was worth it, they said.\n\n“I’m here so my kids will have a better future, will see how . people respect you no matter what color you are, no matter where you’re from, no matter what your religion is,” Nassil said. “That’s what we knew about America. That it’s the country of freedom. You’re free. People will protect you as long as you’re not hurting anyone. I don’t want this to change for them.”\n\nNassil is a paraprofessional for Moore Public Schools, working one-on-one with special needs students. She always makes sure students stand during the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\nNassil said she understands the fearful climate that exists among some Americans and people having concerns about safety. She wants the United States to be safe, too.\n\nAfter all, her family lives here.\n\nRefugees who settle here are protective of the United States, Nassil said. They don’t want to harm the country; they want a new chance in life, and they want to contribute to society, she said.\n\n“We appreciate everything,” Nassil said. “Every single thing.”\n\nArriving in Oklahoma City, the family moved into a two-bedroom apartment with a small TV, a love seat and metal bed frames.\n\nWithin months, the couple started paying the government back for their plane tickets to the United States - $99 a month until they had repaid the entire $4,000.\n\nWithin the first month, Estabraq, who didn’t speak English, had an assembly line job.\n\nAlthough he had years of experience doing HVAC work in Lebanon, he needed a license to do the same type of work in the United States.\n\nFor about a year, Estabraq spent hours every night after work and on the weekends studying for the licensing test, which he passed.\n\nEstabraq has since received several other certifications. Next, he’s planning to apply for a contractor license.\n\n“He’s rocking it,” Nassil said proudly as she showed off two wooden plaques her husband received for being named “Support Employee of the Year and for a Making a Difference Award.\n\nNearby, a vase of red and yellow flowers adorned the center of the family’s dining table. The flowers were a gift from one of Nassil’s students during Teacher Appreciation Week. Nassil has volunteered to make colorful decorations for her school for testing week and other occasions, including posters and cutouts of characters from Pokemon, “Inside Out” and “Star Wars.” The posters were so popular among the students that school officials decided to raffle them off as a fundraiser.\n\nThe principal at Nassil’s school asks her when she’s going to get a teaching certification to teach in the United States. One day, the principal gave Nassil a note that said: “I would love to have you one day as a teacher.”\n\n“When we tell our story, they tell us, ‘Oh, you’re living the American dream,’” Nassil said. “Well, we worked hard, we tried, did our best not to be dependent.”\n\nIn 2014, Nassil and Estabraq bought their first home - a three-bedroom, two-bathroom house in south Oklahoma City. The couple couldn’t buy a house in Lebanon because Palestinians aren’t allowed to own property there.\n\nTheir family is embracing American life and traditions. The couple flipped through photos on their cellphones from their first five years in the U.S.\n\nIn one, the family is dressed in Halloween costumes. In another, the girls are dressed up for Future Career Day at school. Hala is a doctor; Lamar a police officer. Another photo shows Nassil and the girls wearing red, white and blue for the Fourth of July. In another, Lamar holds her ponytail she cut to donate to Locks of Love.\n\nTheir family is so thankful to be here, Nassil said. They want to make the most of every opportunity. They are counting down the days until they can apply for U.S. citizenship later this month.\n\n“We’re so excited and scared,” Nassil said with a laugh. “But hoping for the best.”\n\nAfter the referee blew the final whistle of Hala’s season finale, Nassil clutched her right hand to her chest.\n\nShe had spent the entire game in motion, at times jumping up and down with her dark brown ponytail swishing behind her and other times leaning to the right, her balance teetering on one foot as if she could will the ball into the other team’s goal.\n\n“Oh my goodness!” Nassil said. “That was so stressful!”\n\n“Good job, guys,” Estabraq said, clapping for his team. “Thank you parents.”\n\nNassil hung a medal around each player’s neck and handed out goodie bags filled with sweatbands, stickers and soccer trophies with each child’s name that she had stayed up after practice the night before assembling.\n\n“That’s from the coach,” she said.\n\nWearing their new medals, the players flashed thumbs-up signs and posed for a photo with Estabraq.\n\nWhen Estabraq first decided to volunteer as a coach, Nassil wasn’t sure how it would work out. She worried the kids wouldn’t understand his accent or the parents would think he took the game too seriously. Estabraq played volleyball on the Iraq national team, so athletics are important to him.\n\nAfter the final game, Estabraq apologized to the parents if he was ever too hard on the kids. They argued his apology with applause, a chorus of appreciation and other tokens of thanks.\n\nOne parent gave Estabraq a jar of homemade grape jelly. A red-haired boy ran up and gave him a hug, and a blonde-haired girl asked if he was going to coach again next season. She wasn’t the only one who wanted to know.\n\nEstabraq and Nassil hope to be able to stay with the same group of kids next year. After all, the parents have gotten used to Nassil’s wild cheers, they joked. Estabraq told the team that he and Hala will be practicing this summer. He invited the rest of the players to join them.\n\nThen, he and Nassil packed up their belongings, including a blue folding chair that sat empty for the duration of the game. As their family headed back to the car for the short drive home, Estabraq and Nassil were already looking forward to next season.\n\n“We’re proud of what we’re doing,” Nassil said, “and we’re happy.”\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Oklahoman, http://www.newsok.com	2017-06-26 11:37:29.109248+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	6	711	['The Washington Times Http', 'Darla Spike']

VIRGINIA BEACH, Va.

The protected species faces threats such as pollution and predators that also have rebounded from DDT.\n\nFor instance, great horned owls hunt osprey chicks.

ALLOUEZ, Wis. (AP) - No need to look twice, that really is a velociraptor peering over the fence at the corner of MacArthur Street and Kalb Avenue in Allouez.\n\nSigns warn passers-by of the dangers that lurk beyond Jim Brisbane’s tall wooden fence, USA Today Network-Wisconsin (http://gbpg.net/2smBYET ) reported. One sign shows a yellow circle and the silhouette of a Tyrannosaurus rex and the words “Jurassic Park.”\n\nSwinging open the gate reveals a park “greeter” (a mannequin) and two cheerfully waving skeletons lounging in chairs. There is also a “hatchery” full of baby T. rexes and close by is a watchful pterodactyl.\n\n“I never get tired of looking at this yard,” Brisbane said.\n\nBrisbane, now 72, began gardening 20 years ago after his therapist suggested he needed a hobby to help with his post-traumatic stress disorder.

SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) - Faith Turley, 15, of Lincoln was having a good time putting her soccer skills to use at Bergen Golf Course.\n\nThe teen was playing footgolf with her mom and dad at Bergen’s new certified course. Footgolf is similar to golf, but instead of a golf ball and club, it involves kicking a soccer ball into a 21-inch wide hole in as few kicks as possible.\n\nBergen’s new footgolf course was unveiled to the public on June 11 and the park district offered a free day of play to usher in the new sport. About 115 people, including Faith and her parents, stopped by the golf course to give the new sport a try.\n\n“It’s really fun,” Faith said between holes. “It’s not something I’ve never really experienced before. … It’s interesting combining the two sports together to create a better sport that two different types of athletes can play.”\n\nLynn Saputo, director of recreation for the Springfield Park District, said footgolf will be a regular offering at Bergen.\n\n“We are really excited. I think this is going to boost activity here at the golf course. Also, we are going to encourage outings, teams and birthday parties. People can sign up and have fun out on the course,” Saputo said.\n\nBergen will still offer traditional golf. Footgolf is played in the rough, on the side of the fairway, which means it can be played with traditional golfers on the course. To make it easier on golfers, footgolf will start later in the day.\n\n“We purposefully positioned the timing of this to be after the more busy time of golfing in the morning,” Saputo said. “Golfers typically like to get on the course between 6:30 and 7 a.m. We pushed the weekday play of footgolf after 11 a.m. on purpose. It doesn’t mean the two can’t be played simultaneously, but we did want to be conscious and respectful of our traditional golfers and the game they like to play.”\n\nSince some footgolf participants may not be familiar with golf courses, the park district will be teaching players some basic golf etiquette so the interaction with traditional golfers goes as smooth as possible.\n\nWhile Bergen is a nine-hole golf course, there are 18 holes set up for footgolf. The distance from the tee area to the hole is staggered so that people with different skill levels can enjoy the game. The different tees are color-coded.\n\n“The blue tee is the farthest. It’s about 100 to 120 yards,” Saputo said. “It’s about 70 yards kicking off from the red tee.”\n\nFaith’s previous soccer experience was a definite benefit, but the whole family was enjoying the game.\n\n“She’s much better at it than we are, but the whole family can do this,” said Faith’s dad, Brian Turley. “The group we’re with is having a lot of fun. It’s a nice day out here and it’s good exercise walking the course.”\n\nLaquesha Russell of Springfield and her 12-year-old son were with the Turleys on the course.\n\n“It’s interesting. It’s fun for the children to get out, enjoy the weather and learn something new,” Russell said. “Everybody is enjoying themselves.”\n\n___\n\nSource: The (Springfield) State Journal-Register, http://bit.ly/2rtvBMh\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The State Journal-Register, http://www.sj-r.com	2017-06-26 11:38:33.983808+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	6	726	['The Washington Times Http', 'John Reynolds']

President Donald Trump, making a final push to fulfill a key campaign promise, insists Republicans are not “that far off” and signaled last-minute changes are coming to win votes.\n\n“We have a very good plan,” Trump said in an interview aired Sunday. Referring to Republican senators opposed to the bill, he added: “They want to get some points, I think they’ll get some points.”\n\nSo far, five Republican senators are expressing opposition to the Senate GOP plan that would scuttle much of former President Barack Obama’s health law. That’s more than enough to torpedo the measure developed in private by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and deliver a bitter defeat for the president.\n\nThe holdouts are expressing willingness to negotiate, but many of them are pushing revisions that could risk alienating moderate Republicans in the process.\n\nSen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said seven to eight additional senators including herself were troubled by provisions in the Senate bill that she believes could cut Medicaid for the poor even more than the House version. Collins, who also opposes proposed cuts to Planned Parenthood, said she was awaiting the CBO analysis before taking a final position. But she said it will be “extremely difficult” for the White House to be able to find a narrow path to attract both conservatives and moderates.\n\nThe CBO cost estimate, including an analysis on the number of people likely to be covered, is expected to be released as early as Monday.\n\n“It’s hard for me to see the bill passing this week,” Collins said.\n\nSen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., one of the five senators opposing the bill, said he also wants to review the CBO score.\n\n“I would like to delay,” he said. “These bills aren’t going to fix the problem. They’re not addressing the root cause,” he said, referring to rising health care costs. “They’re doing the same old Washington thing, throwing more money at the problem.”\n\nIn the broadcast interview, Trump did not indicate what types of changes to the Senate bill may be in store, but affirmed that he had described a House-passed bill as “mean.”\n\n“I want to see a bill with heart,” he said, confirming a switch from his laudatory statements about the House bill at a Rose Garden ceremony with House GOP leaders last month. “Health care’s a very complicated subject from the standpoint that you move it this way, and this group doesn’t like it.”\n\n“And honestly, nobody can be totally happy,” Trump said.\n\nMcConnell has said he’s willing to make changes to win support, and in the week ahead, plenty of backroom bargaining is expected. He is seeking to push a final package through the Senate before the July 4 recess.\n\nAddressing reporters Sunday, the Senate’s No. 2 Republican said passing a health care bill won’t get any easier if Republican leaders delay a Senate vote on the GOP health care plan. Sen. John Cornyn of Texas said there is “a sense of urgency” to push forward but acknowledged the outcome is “going to be close.”\n\nHe told reporters at a private gathering hosted by the libertarian Koch brothers in Colorado that Trump will be “important” in securing the final votes.\n\n“We’re trying to hold him back a little bit,” Cornyn said with a smile.\n\nThe Senate bill resembles legislation the House approved last month. A CBO analysis of the House measure predicts an additional 23 million people over the next decade would have no health care coverage, and recent polling shows only around 1 in 4 Americans views the House bill favorably.\n\nThe legislation would phase out extra federal money that more than 30 states receive for expanding Medicaid to additional low-income earners. It would also slap annual spending caps on the overall Medicaid program, which since its inception in 1965 has provided states with unlimited money to cover eligible costs.\n\nConservative Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said he is opposing the Senate bill because it “is not anywhere close to repeal” of the Affordable Care Act. He says the bill offers too many tax credits that help poorer people to buy insurance.\n\n“If we get to impasse, if we go to a bill that is more repeal and less big government programs, yes, I’ll consider partial repeal,” he said. “I’m not voting for something that looks just like Obamacare.”\n\nTrump said he thinks Republicans in the Senate are doing the best they can to push through the bill.\n\n“I don’t think they’re that far off. Famous last words, right? But I think they’re going to get there,” Trump said of Republican Senate leaders. “We don’t have too much of a choice, because the alternative is the dead carcass of Obamacare.”\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said Democrats have been clear they will cooperate with Republicans if they agree to drop a repeal of the Affordable Care Act and instead work to improve it. Still, Schumer acknowledged it was too close to call as to whether Republicans could muster enough support on their own to pass the bill.\n\nHe said they had “at best, a 50-50 chance.”\n\nTrump was interviewed by “Fox & Friends,” while Collins, Schumer and Paul appeared on ABC’s “This Week.” Johnson spoke on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Steve Peoples in Colorado Springs, Colorado, contributed to this report.	2017-06-26 11:39:39.203949+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	6	739	['The Washington Times Http', 'Hope Yen']

Then neighbour Steve arrived at her doorstep with the ailing moggy in a box.\n\n(Photo: cascadenews.co.uk)\n\nVet Steve Calveley, who treated the cat at Charter Veterinary Surgery in Newcastle under Lyme, said: "We couldn't believe how he had survived such an incredible experience. He was in intensive care and, after sorting his tail out, we turned our attention to the extensive burns he had suffered.\n\n"This included treating the burns with manuka honey, which contains certain antiseptic properties that helps the healing process.\n\n(Photo: cascadenews.co.uk)\n\n"I also think Ronney's fantastic recovery is in part down to him being a very good-natured cat.

I also think it's down to my brilliant team of veterinary nurses who have been totally dedicated to Ronney's care throughout the process."\n\n(Photo: cascadenews.co.uk)\n\nGrateful owner Katrina, a nurse, who lives with her 20-year-old son Gabriel said: "Ronney was extremely traumatised so I kept him quiet and he had a few sips of water and a tiny bit of tuna and salmon."\n\n"We've had Ronney all his life, since he was born on my living room floor after I rescued his pregnant mum Sassy.\n\n"He's a lovely natured cat and never goes very far. He is a bit of a scaredy-cat and the furthest he ever goes is along the walls of the houses nearby so it was unusual when he went missing.\n\n(Photo: cascadenews.co.uk)\n\n"We knew he wouldn't have gone far and my son Gabriel went out looking for him, while I put up posters and knocked on doors.\n\n"This all happened on a Thursday and, as the days went by, I was getting really worried. The worst bit was not knowing what had happened.\n\n"On the Sunday evening, there was a knock at the door and it was a gentleman who lives next door but one. He had Ronney in a toy box and said, 'I think I've got your cat.' I couldn't believe it, particularly when I found out how far Ronney had travelled - on a hot engine! I was so grateful I bought him wine and chocolates."\n\n(Photo: cascadenews.co.uk)\n\nVet Steve, whose Charter Veterinary Surgery is part of the independently-owned Willows Veterinary Group said: "Ronney has become something of a celeb here, everyone loves him. They say cats have nine lives but I think in Ronney's case it's more like 12."\n\nVets found first degree burns which had gone through his skin to muscle underneath.\n\nSteve hopes that Ronney can return home in three to four weeks, while in the meantime, owner Katrina visits him on her days off. "I visit Ronney around three times a week and am really looking forward to having him home permanently," she added.	2017-06-26 07:33:29.508559+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	18	700	['John Jeffay', 'Photo', 'Cascadenews.Co.Uk']

JONATHAN FORD (CHAIR): I want to start by asking where we are in the crisis. Is it over? George Soros, you have said that this is the worst crisis we have been through for 60 years. Presumably you still believe that there is worse to come?\n\nGEORGE SOROS: There is now a widespread belief that the crisis is over. I think, on the contrary, that the effect on the real economy is yet to be felt. The measures taken by the authorities will not bring recovery. There are four reasons for this. First, the fall in house prices in the US is only halfway over and in Britain it has hardly begun. Second, consumers have been slow to adjust their spending habits, but this is about to happen. Third, the financial system is severely wounded, and even though banks have been remarkably successful at raising more equity, they will cut back on lending and this will feed through to capital spending and business activity. Finally, and most important, there is a threat of inflation at the same time as a slowdown. The rise in energy and food prices will turn the slowdown into a recession.\n\nANATOLE KALETSKY: I agree with George that the threat of inflation is potentially the most alarming new factor in this crisis, but I would challenge the other three points. The worst is over in the real economy in the US, although not yet in Britain and Europe. US house prices do not have much further to fall, and consumer spending will hold up. While there are, indeed, several trillion dollars of consumer spending to come out of the system, the impact may be quite comfortably spread over many years. And while the financial system has been wounded, the bank writedowns—in the US at least—have already gone beyond what is plausible in terms of likely losses. There is one shoe that has yet to drop: the continental European banks, which have not recognised the losses to the same extent.	2017-06-26 11:41:01.829785+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	38	781

It’s not about intentionally trying to hurt anybody it’s about playing hard and fair.”\n\nGatland has every right to speak up for his players if he feels their well being is at risk from dirty tricks. But Hansen simply does not accept that is the case.\n\nFive days out from the second Test in the windy city of Wellington, he said he did not know where Gatland was coming from, before venturing a guess that "he might be a bit desperate".\n\nHansen added: “Wasn’t it a great Test match?

1060	Mark Shenton’s week: The rise of Kenny Wax, the West End’s new president		https://cdn.thestage.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/1534Kenny-Wax.jpg	https://www.thestage.co.uk/opinion/2017/mark-shentons-week-rise-kenny-wax-west-ends-new-president/	\N	The appointment of Kenny Wax this week to the top position of president of the Society of London Theatre caps a rise that has seen him really hit his stride as a major player in the West End, on the touring road and beyond, all the way to Broadway.\nHe subsequently went to work for Imagination, where he was responsible for bringing the Broadway musical Once on this Island to the West End, but was always determined to make it on his own.\nHis first big solo project was shepherding an original British musical called Maddie from a try-out at Salisbury Playhouse in 1996 to a full West End run at the Lyric in 1997.\nBut he has also learned how to play the West End game, too, and didn't rush into it when he brought a stage version of Top Hat to the stage in 2011.\nLast Christmas he had three of the company's shows running simultaneously in the West End.	The appointment of Kenny Wax this week to the top position of president of the Society of London Theatre caps a rise that has seen him really hit his stride as a major player in the West End, on the touring road and beyond, all the way to Broadway. (He is currently represented in New York by the transfer of The Play That Goes Wrong that he first took an interest in when it was a one-act show at Trafalgar Studios then enhanced for a tour and brought to the Duchess).\n\nI should declare an interest even as I declare how inordinately proud of him I am: he and I first met at Dewynters in the late 1980s, where he was initially a humble foot messenger (these were the days before email and even faxes, so he'd hand-deliver packages of artwork for approval by clients direct to their offices), before he became a media buying assistant.\n\nAll the while, he was doing odd jobs in theatre elsewhere, such as ushering at Drury Lane and followspot-operating on Cats. I remember fondly when he produced his first show, a little one-night musical revue at the King's Head called Kicking the Clouds Away. He subsequently went to work for Imagination, where he was responsible for bringing the Broadway musical Once on this Island to the West End, but was always determined to make it on his own.\n\nHis first big solo project was shepherding an original British musical called Maddie from a try-out at Salisbury Playhouse in 1996 to a full West End run at the Lyric in 1997. It failed, and as he told me in 2015: “Looking back, it was a ridiculously optimistic thing to do. I don’t love the show any less, but were I to do it now, I’d do it very differently. Part of producing is about choosing a good property and a great director and team, but choosing the journey the show goes on is also very important."\n\nAnd Kenny has duly gone on quite a journey. Like all producers, he's had his knock-backs – a West End revival of Neil LaBute's play The Shape of Things at the Ambassadors in 2004 was also a fast flop – but each time he was undaunted and regrouped, refocusing his attentions on lucrative touring children's shows in which he cornered a market.\n\nBut he has also learned how to play the West End game, too, and didn't rush into it when he brought a stage version of Top Hat to the stage in 2011. He launched it out-of-town as part of a tour in Milton Keynes, and I remember going to see one of its first performances. After the show, I gave him some notes: I told him that he had a show there, but he needed a new book writer (It was co-credited to director Matthew White and someone called Howard Jacques). What I didn't know was that Jacques was a pseudonym for himself. Oops!\n\nHe took the show back to the drawing board after its first tour, and then toured it again in early 2012 before finally opening at the Aldwych in April that year. It subsequently won the Olivier for best musical in 2013 – after which it toured successfully again.\n\nBut it is with the Mischief franchise that Wax has finally found his cash cow. Last Christmas he had three of the company's shows running simultaneously in the West End. It was good, old-fashioned producing: he'd seen an early version of their first, independently produced show The Play That Goes Wrong at Trafalgar Studios 2, and offered to enhance it for a regional tour that he booked.\n\nThe rest is now history. Plays that go wrong are now the bread and butter of what has taken Wax to the top of the producing tree.\n\nFlying the flag for diversity\n\nIn the wake of David Lan's announcement to step down from running the Young Vic, I wrote a column in which I suggested six possible candidates to replace him. This was by no means intended to be a comprehensive survey of everyone who might be eligible to throw their hat in the ring or who might be considered, but just a few suggestions.\n\nI've duly been taken to task by Simeilia Hodge-Dallaway, founder and executive manager of Artistic Directors of the Future, accusing my list of "being dated, lazy and a prime example of how the industry contributes to the invisibility of culturally diverse leaders".\n\nActually, diversity is a subject I have regularly drawn attention to and championed in my journalism, celebrating it wherever it appears. After seeing Sheffield's recent production of Julius Caesar, for instance, I noted it had a striking contemporaneity, "and that was to do with the obviously intentional colour, gender and disability blindness of its casting. It was remarkably unremarkable that this was taking place; no particular attention was drawn to any of it, just an easy acceptance that these actors were drawn from all sectors of society."\n\nAnd yes, of course artistic leadership needs to reflect that, and increasingly is. Just last week, Nadia Fall was appointed to replace Kerry Michael at Stratford East. Hodge-Dallaway states that it's "completely baffling to me how such a list can be printed in 2017, when there are exemplary, culturally diverse leaders such as Kwame Kwei-Armah, Madani Younis, Kully Thiarai and Indhu Rubasingham running mainstream institutions." The fact that Kwei-Armah is running such an institution in the US need not detain us; but each of these are already in a job. Five of the six candidates I proposed don't (or, in the case of Emma Rice, soon won't).\n\nMy list was purely a starting point. I'm glad that she's added to it now – and an awareness of such issues is definitely important. It is Hodge-Dallaway’s campaigning role to increase that visibility. But she shouldn’t simply write off the list I've provided as seemingly "safe" choices. That's extremely disrespectful, too, to the work that the likes of Joe Hill-Gibbins, Carrie Cracknell, Simon Stone and Richard Jones have put in at the Young Vic, or Emma Rice and Tom Morris elsewhere. If there's anything they have in common, it is that none of them are 'safe'.\n\nTheatrical representations of disability\n\nFor all the talk of diversity on our stages, there's usually little recognition of disability within that spectrum. So it was doubly refreshing to catch the current tour of The Who's Tommy at Stratford East recently, a co-production between the New Wolsey Theatre and disabled theatre consortium Ramps on the Moon.\n\nThe Stage's Fergus Morgan wrote in his review: "The concept is inspired. A musical about a young child shocked into 'deafness, dumbness and blindness' by the death of his dapper RAF dad, staged by disabled and non-disabled performers. Michael's cast – some in wheelchairs, some with hearing aids, some voiced by back-up singers – knock the stuffing out of Pete Townshend's score, finding layer upon layer of parallelism without ever sacrificing drama or drive."\n\nAfter seeing it, I tweeted: "The Who's TOMMY is given blazing staging at @stratfordeast that appropriately stretches diversity casting to include deaf/disabled actors."\n\nDue to an unfortunate autocorrect error, deaf in that tweet got changed to dead when I first wrote it! As a friend commented on Facebook, "Dead? Now that IS diverse." And as another replied, "Everybody has a right to work..."\n\nAs I also tweeted: "Use of deaf & disabled actors in The Who's TOMMY @stratfordeast shouldn't be as surprising as it is but it's a thrill to see nonetheless."	2017-06-26 11:37:00.744951+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	48	705	['Mark Shenton', 'Lyn Gardner', 'Andrzej Lukowski']

Actor Ben Lloyd-Hughes is currently performing in Kiss Me at Trafalgar Studios, which tells an unorthodox love story set in post-First World War London. He discusses the show and his acting journey so far with Giverny Masso...\n\nWhat interested you about Kiss Me?\n\nI love the script, it’s such an interesting concept. The character I’m playing goes around London visiting war widows and having sex with them to try to give them babies. It reminds me a bit of the [Strindberg] play Miss Julie and that sense of two characters from different worlds meeting in a heightened state. It is such a privilege to do a two-hander with so much text and opportunity.\n\nYou originally performed this play at Hampstead Theatre in London in 2016 – how have things changed this time?\n\nWe’ve made tiny changes here and there. The main difference is the staging. We’ve gone from traverse to thrust, which means we use completely different positions. For the first few days I was thinking: “Am I trying to replay what we did before, or trying to find something new?” There was a certain amount of realising why we did or said certain things.\n\nHow did you first get into acting?\n\nThrough school. You need someone who believes in you. I was lucky to have a drama teacher who cast me in interesting parts. The arts cuts in schools are terrible. To devalue the arts, to suggest they are a pastime and an extracurricular hobby, is so arrogant. How is anyone expected to expand their mind?\n\nWhat have been your other career highlights?\n\nDoing Skins was such a game-changing series for me – to have young people at the centre of it and to be in these stories. It was something where I thought: “I can do more of this”. I was also involved in the National Youth Theatre when I was younger. It is a fantastic institution that helps young people to expand their horizons, and I’ve also run some workshops for them. Other highlights include being in the film Divergent, which was a high-budget film shot in Chicago. I also enjoyed being in Future Conditional at the Old Vic, and doing Henry V with Jude Law.\n\nWhat have you found to be the biggest challenge in your career?\n\nThe biggest challenge for me has been being seen – to do great work people see. My career progressed because people saw my stuff and said: “I like that.” I always felt very frustrated that I had all the confidence but no one would give me the chance. Talking to other actors, I’ve found it is very easy if you have knockbacks to think: “I will make a bland choice next time.” You’ve got to take risks. For me, my biggest risk was to go to drama school. I was 18 or 19 and already working in TV. A lot of people were saying “don’t go to drama school”. It was about wanting to get better, and I was a young actor who wanted to do more theatre.\n\nCV: Ben Lloyd-Hughes\n\nTraining: Guildhall School of Music and Drama (2008-11)\n\nFirst professional role: Love Soup, BBC (2005)\n\nAgent: Christian Hodell\n\nKiss Me is playing at Trafalgar Studios until July 8	2017-06-26 11:37:04.053676+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	48	708	['Giverny Masso', 'Paul Vale', 'Matt Trueman']

WASHINGTON (AP) - Before taking their long summer break, the Supreme Court justices are poised to act on the Trump administration’s travel ban and a separation of church and state dispute involving a Missouri church playground.\n\nBut something could overshadow rulings in those high-profile cases: If Justice Anthony Kennedy were to use the court’s last public session on Monday to announce his retirement.\n\nKennedy has given no public sign that he would step down this year and give President Donald Trump his second high court pick in the first months of his administration. Kennedy’s departure would allow conservatives to take firm control of the court.\n\nBut Kennedy turns 81 next month and has been on the court for nearly 30 years. Several of his former law clerks have said they think he is contemplating stepping down in the next year or so. Kennedy did not address the retirement rumors when he and his clerks gathered over the weekend for a reunion, according to three clerks who were there. The decision to push up the reunion by a year helped spark talk he might be leaving the court.\n\nThe justices on Monday were expected to decide the case of Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Missouri, which was excluded from a state grant program to pay for soft surfaces on playgrounds run by not-for-profit groups.\n\nThe case was being closely watched by advocates of school vouchers, who hope the court will make it easier to use state money to pay for private, religious schooling in states that now prohibit it.\n\nMissouri has since changed its policy under Republican Gov. Eric Greitens so that churches may now apply for the money.\n\nAlso expected in the next few days, though there’s no deadline by which the court must decide, was a ruling on whether to allow the administration to immediately enforce a 90-day ban on visitors from six mostly Muslim countries.\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch, Trump’s first Supreme Court nominee, could play a pivotal role in both the travel ban and church playground cases.\n\nIn all, six cases that were argued between November and April remain undecided. Three of those, all involving immigrants or foreigners, were heard by an eight-justice court, before Gorsuch joined the bench in April.\n\nIf the eight justices are evenly divided, those cases could be argued a second time in the fall, with Gorsuch available to provide the tie-breaking vote.\n\nBefore the Supreme Court justices begin their long summer break, they’re poised to act on the Trump administration’s travel ban and a separation of church and state dispute involving a Missouri church playground.\n\nBut something could overshadow rulings in those high-profile cases: If Justice Anthony Kennedy were to use the court’s last public session on Monday to announce his retirement.\n\nKennedy has given no public sign that he would step down this year, but he turns 81 next month and has been on the court for nearly 30 years.

WASHINGTON (AP) - President Donald Trump is not known for plunging into the details of complex policy issues, and health care is no exception. Since his campaign days, Trump has addressed health care in broad, aspirational strokes. Nonetheless he made some clear promises along the way.\n\nThose promises come under two big headings. First, what Trump would do about the Affordable Care Act, his predecessor’s health care law, often called “Obamacare.” Second, the kind of health care system that Trump envisions for Americans.\n\nOn repealing Obama’s law, Trump seems to have a realistic chance to deliver. But he’s nowhere close to fulfilling his generous promises of affordable health care for all.\n\nA look at some of the president’s major health care promises, and how the Republican legislation advancing in Congress lines up with them:\n\nREPEAL ‘OBAMACARE’\n\nRepealing President Barack Obama’s signature domestic achievement has been a clear and consistent promise from Trump. Under the Obama law, some 20 million people gained coverage through a combination of subsidized private insurance and a state option to expand Medicaid for low-income people. Costs have been a problem, as are shaky insurance markets for people buying their own policies. But the nation’s uninsured rate is at a historic low, about 9 percent.\n\nBoth the House and SenateGOP bills would largely fulfill Trump’s promise to repeal Obama’s law.\n\nBoth bills end Obama’s unpopular requirement for individuals to carry health insurance or risk fines. The legislation also phases down the Medicaid expansion and repeals hundreds of billions of dollars in taxes on upper-income people and health care industries, used under Obama to finance coverage. And it opens the way for states to seek waivers of federal health insurance requirements.\n\nSome Republican critics on the right say the congressional bills leave other major parts of “Obamacare” in place, such as subsidies for people buying private insurance, and too many rules. While the subsidy structure would remain, much less taxpayer money is invested in it.\n\n“INSURANCE FOR EVERYBODY”\n\nIn a Washington Post interview before his inauguration, Trump distilled his vision for health care into a few visionary goals.\n\n“We’re going to have insurance for everybody,” he said. “There was a philosophy in some circles that if you can’t pay for it, you don’t get it. That’s not going to happen with us.”\n\nTrump said he was close to finishing a plan of his own that would have “lower numbers, much lower deductibles.”\n\nBut the White House never delivered a health care plan from the president.\n\nAnd the congressional plans are likely to increase the number of uninsured people, because even if all Americans have access to coverage, some may no longer be able to afford it.\n\nDeductibles are likely to rise for many people with individual coverage because the congressional plans would end subsidies under Obama’s law that reduced out-of-pocket costs for those with modest incomes.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office has projected that, on average, premiums for individual policies would be lower over the long run than under current law. But there would be winners and losers. Younger adults and those in good health are likely to find better deals. Older people and those requiring comprehensive coverage could well end up paying more.\n\nTAKING AWAY THE LINES\n\nDuring the presidential campaign, Trump called for a system in which insurance plans would compete nationally, offering Americans choice and lower premiums.\n\n“What I’d like to see is a private system without the artificial lines around every state,” he said at one of the presidential debates.\n\nMany experts say Trump’s vision of interstate competition is unrealistic because health insurance, like real estate, reflects local prices. In any case, it remains unfulfilled in the GOP legislation.\n\nSome congressional leaders have promised that cross-state insurance will be addressed in follow-on legislation. Such a bill, however, would likely have to meet a 60-vote test in the Senate.\n\nPRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES\n\nDuring the presidential campaign, and since becoming president, Trump called for action to bring down the cost of prescription drugs.\n\nThe GOP bills in Congress basically sidestep that.\n\nAt one point in the campaign, Trump called for giving Medicare the authority to directly negotiate prices with drug makers, an approach favored to some extent by Obama and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump also proposed letting Americans import prescription drugs from other countries, where prices are usually lower because of government regulation.\n\nBut Medicare negotiations are a nonstarter for most congressional Republicans, and Trump’s call for allowing drug importation has faded.\n\nMEDICAID\n\nIn a 2015 interview with The Daily Signal, Trump said: “I’m not going to cut Social Security like every other Republican and I’m not going to cut Medicare or Medicaid.”\n\nBut last year, his campaign started backtracking on the Medicaid promise, endorsing the idea of limited federal financing for the federal-state program that covers some 70 million low-income people, from newborns to elderly nursing home residents, from special-needs kids to part-time workers lacking job-based health insurance.\n\nThe Republican bills in Congress would phase out Obama’s financing for Medicaid expansion and limit future federal payments for the entire program as well. The Congressional Budget Office said the House bill would reduce federal Medicaid spending by $834 billion over 10 years, and the program would cover about 14 million fewer people by 2026, a 17 percent reduction.\n\nSeveral Republican governors have joined their Democratic counterparts calling that a massive cost-shift to the states.\n\nOPIOID CRISIS\n\nThe Trump White House says it’s serious about confronting the nation’s opioid epidemic, which shows no sign of letup.\n\n“The president is all in,” health secretary Tom Price said on a recent visit to New Hampshire. “He has such passion for this issue because he knows the misery and the suffering that has occurred across this land.”\n\nBut state officials say rolling back Obama’s Medicaid expansion would deal a heavy blow to their efforts to treat addiction and get its victims back to jobs and family. Among the group of low-income adults made eligible for Medicaid under Obama are many younger people struggling with drug problems. They’ve been able to get treatment and support services through Medicaid.\n\nThe Senate bill would set up a $2 billion fund to help states fight the epidemic; some GOP senators had sought $45 billion. The House bill does not address it.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press researcher Jennifer Farrar contributed to this report.	2017-06-26 11:37:51.946742+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	6	716	['The Washington Times Http', 'Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar']

WASHINGTON (AP) - Months after U.S. intelligence settled on Russia as the instigator of interference in the U.S. election, President Donald Trump’s team struggles to tell a straight story on the matter.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump senior adviser Kellyanne Conway wrongly credited Trump with taking Russian hacking seriously and calling it a “disgrace” once a consensus formed that Moscow was behind the mischief.\n\nA look at her comment and some statements by Trump on a variety of subjects over the past week:\n\nCONWAY: “What the president has already done, when he was confronted with this information in January, he said it’s a, quote, disgrace. He thinks Russia was involved, but that others are hacking, too.” - on ABC’s “This Week.”\n\nTHE FACTS: Trump didn’t call Russian hacking a disgrace. That’s a word he used about something else.\n\nIn a pre-inauguration press conference Jan. 11, Trump reacted angrily to the leak of a dossier containing unverified, salacious information about his behavior during a visit to Moscow. U.S. intelligence officials briefed him on the dossier and elements were reported publicly. That’s what he was livid about. “I think it’s a disgrace that information that was false and fake and never happened got released to the public,” he said. “I think it’s a disgrace that information would be let out.”\n\nAs for hacking the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s campaign, he told that news conference, “I think it was Russia. But I think we also get hacked by other countries and other people.”\n\nThe statement followed the release of an intelligence report Jan. 6 pointing unequivocally to Russian cyber operations and propaganda to try to help Trump’s 2016 election chances and hurt Clinton‘s.\n\nTrump has remained skeptical or dismissive in the months since about the findings concerning Russia’s behavior.\n\n“I’ll go along with Russia,” he said grudgingly to CBS on April 30. “Could’ve been China, could’ve been a lot of different groups.”\n\nOn May 11 he told NBC he wants to know about it “if Russia did anything.” And last week, press secretary Sean Spicer said he did not know whether Trump believed Russia interfered in the election.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: “We’re thinking about building the wall as a solar wall so it creates energy and pays for itself. And this way, Mexico will have to pay much less money. And that’s good right? … Pretty good imagination, right? Good? My idea.” - in Iowa on Wednesday.\n\nTHE FACTS: His idea? Others came forward with such proposals back when he was criticizing solar power as too expensive.\n\nThe notion of adding solar panels to the wall he wants to build along the Mexico border was explored in a Wall Street Journal op-ed in March. Vasilis Fthenakis, director of the Center for Life Cycle Analysis at Columbia University, and Ken Zweibel, former director of the Solar Institute at George Washington University, concluded it was “not only technically and economically feasible, it might even be more practical than a traditional wall.”\n\nThey said a 2,000-mile solar wall could cost less than $1 billion, instead of tens of billions for a traditional border wall, and possibly become “wildly profitable.” The writers were studying a concept laid out by Homero Aridjis and James Ramey in the online World Post in December.\n\nThe idea also was proposed by one of the companies that submitted its design to the government as a border wall prototype. Las Vegas-based Gleason Partners proposed covering some sections of the wall with solar panels and said that selling electricity from it could eventually cover the cost of construction.\n\nTrump repeatedly described solar power in the campaign as “very, very expensive” and “not working so good.”\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: “So, we’ve achieved a historic increase in defense spending.” - Iowa speech.\n\nTHE FACTS: He hasn’t. He is proposing a large increase but Congress is still debating - and is nowhere near deciding on - more money for defense for 2018.\n\nAll that’s been achieved is a $25 billion increase for this year and there’s nothing remotely historic about that. The Pentagon has received annual budget increases equal to or greater than $25 billion seven times in the past 15 years alone.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: “The time has come for new immigration rules which say that those seeking admission into our country must be able to support themselves financially and should not use welfare for a period of at least five years. And we’ll be putting in legislation to that effect very shortly.” - Iowa speech.\n\nTHE FACTS: A federal law passed in 1996 already has that effect. It bars most foreigners who enter the country on immigrant visas from being eligible for federal benefits like Social Security and food stamps for the first five years. States typically have the authority to determine eligibility for local programs. As for people in the country illegally, they are generally prohibited from those benefits altogether. Same with foreigners who are in the U.S. on nonimmigrant visas.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: Addressing why he raised the possibility that his Oval Office conversation with fired FBI Director James Comey might have been recorded: “When he found out that I, you know, that there may be tapes out there, whether it’s governmental tapes or anything else, and who knows, I think his story may have changed.” - Fox News interview aired Friday.\n\nTHE FACTS: There’s no evidence of any change in what Comey testified on June 8 before the Senate Intelligence committee. In that appearance - the only time Comey has publicly addressed the subject - his story was consistent. He said that on three occasions beginning in January he’d told the president that he was not then the subject of an FBI counterintelligence investigation on him as part of its work to probe Russian influence on the 2016 presidential election.\n\nSince then, it has been reported that Trump is under investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller over his May 9 firing of Comey and whether that or other actions by the president constitute obstruction of justice.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: “You see what we’ve already done. Homebuilders are starting to build again. We’re not confiscating their land with ridiculous rules and regulations that don’t make sense.” - Iowa speech.\n\nTHE FACTS: Housing starts as tracked by the Census Bureau have actually fallen over the past three months. Trump seems a bit mixed up on deregulation. Some of the biggest constraints on homebuilders come from local governments, rather than federal rules.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: On cutting regulations to help farmers: “Farmers are able to plow their field. If they have a puddle in the middle of their field, a little puddle the size of this, it’s considered a lake and you can’t touch it. And if you touch it, bad, bad things happen to you and your family. We got rid of that one, too, OK?” - Iowa speech\n\nTHE FACTS: He didn’t get rid of the regulations he’s talking about. He signed an executive order in February directing the Environmental Protection Agency to review a rule protecting clean water. The rule can stop some farmers from using pesticides and herbicides. It’s still in place, pending the review.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: “Former Homeland Security Advisor Jeh Johnson is latest top intelligence official to state there was no grand scheme between Trump & Russia.” - tweet Thursday.\n\nTHE FACTS: Johnson did not state that conclusion. He was homeland security secretary (not adviser) from December 2013 to January 2017. He was asked at a House Intelligence committee hearing Wednesday whether he knew of any evidence of collusion with Russia by the Trump campaign.\n\nJohnson said he was not aware of any information beyond what’s been reported publicly and what the U.S. intelligence community has gathered. That is not a statement of belief that no collusion took place. Pressed on the matter, he said Comey probably had some information to go on when the FBI opened an investigation into possible collusion.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: “We are 5 and 0, as you know, in these special elections. And I think the Democrats thought it would be a lot different than that. 5-0 is a big - that’s a big margin.” - Fox News interview aired Friday.\n\nTHE FACTS: Wrong score. Right score: 4-1. Republicans won open House seats in Kansas, Georgia, Montana and South Carolina. Democrats held onto a seat in California.\n\nTrump’s miscount wasn’t a one-time gaffe. It was also a line that roused supporters in his Iowa speech. “So, we’re 5 and 0. We’re 5 and 0,” he said to applause Wednesday night. “Five and 0. Five and 0,” he said at another point.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: “Since I was elected, illegal border crossings - and this is without the wall, before the wall - have decreased by more than 75 percent, a historic and unprecedented achievement.” - Iowa speech.\n\nTHE FACTS: That’s overblown, according to government figures about the Mexico border. The decrease in his first four full months in office is about 59 percent, still substantial but not more than 75 percent.\n\nMore than 56,600 foreigners have been caught crossing from Mexico illegally between February and May, down from 137,800 people in the same period during President Barack Obama’s last year in office.\n\nThe number of illegal crossings is not known because some people slip in undetected. Officials consider the number arrested to be representative of the broader trend of attempts to cross illegally.\n\nIn bragging that the numbers are down “without the wall,” Trump omits the fact that there already are roughly 650 miles of fencing along the nearly 2,000-mile long Mexican border.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: “We’re working really hard on massive tax cuts. It would be, if I get it the way I want it, the largest tax cut in the history of the United States of America. Because right now, we are one of the highest-taxed nations in the world. Really on a large-scale basis, we are the highest tax nation in the world. … And I think it’s going to happen.” - Iowa speech.\n\nTHE FACTS: The overall U.S. tax burden is actually one of the lowest among the 32 developed and large emerging-market economies tracked by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\n\nTaxes made up 26.4 percent of the total U.S. economy in 2015, according to the OECD. That’s far below Denmark’s tax burden of 46.6 percent, Britain’s 32.5 percent or Germany’s 36.9 percent. Just four OECD countries had a lower tax bite than the U.S.: South Korea, Ireland, Chile and Mexico.\n\nIt’s not clear Trump will sign the largest tax cut in U.S. history. His administration has yet to settle on enough details of any planned overhaul to make that claim. To put the claim in context, President Ronald Reagan essentially cut taxes during his first term by slightly more than 2 percent of the nation’s gross domestic product. For Trump to surpass that, his tax cut would essentially have to be more than $400 billion a year.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: “We have Gary Cohn, who’s the president of Goldman Sachs. That’s somebody. He’s the president of Goldman Sachs. He had to pay over $200 million in taxes to take the job, right? … This is the president of Goldman Sachs, smart. Having him represent us. He went from massive paydays to peanuts. … But these are people that are great, brilliant business minds. And that’s what we need.” - Iowa speech.\n\nTHE FACTS: Trump appears to be confusing taxes paid with stocks sold. Cohn and his family members held about $220 million in Goldman stock, which he had to divest in order to resolve possible conflicts of interest before becoming White House economic adviser. He would have had to pay taxes on any capital gains from the sale, but that sum would only be a fraction of the figure cited by Trump. Moreover, Cohn had to divest the stock in pieces, so the final tally from his sales is unclear, as the stock has declined from highs in March.\n\nIt’s also worth noting the president’s about-face praise for Wall Street. His campaign routinely criticized Goldman Sachs and its ties to Hillary Clinton, even using it as a villain in a political ad that included video of the bank’s chairman and CEO.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: “You have a gang called MS-13. … They do things that nobody can believe. These are true animals. We are moving them out of the country by the thousands, by the thousands. … We’re getting them out, MS-13.” - Iowa speech.\n\nTHE FACTS: There is no publicly available evidence to support this claim about the violent gang. In recent weeks, federal authorities have arrested hundreds of suspected MS-13 gang members. Many of those arrested have been identified by the government as immigrants, but it is unclear if they have yet been deported. Any suspected gang members who are U.S. citizens cannot be kicked out of the country. The gang was formed decades ago in Los Angeles and has spread.\n\nOverall arrests of immigrants in the country illegally have increased in recent months, but deportations have declined slightly, according to the most recently available government data.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Josh Boak, Alicia A.

1074	Koch urgency: Conservative network fears closing window		http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2017/06/26/koch_donors_25368.jpg	http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jun/26/koch-urgency-conservative-network-fears-closing-wi/	\N	No agenda items mattered more to the conservative Koch network than the GOP’s promise to overhaul the nation’s tax code and repeal and replace President Barack Obama’s health care law.\nKoch officials said that the network’s midterm budget for policy and politics is between $300 million and $400 million.\nThe group is actively lobbying Senate Republicans to change their current health care proposal, which it views as insufficiently conservative.\nAnother Koch donor, Chris Wright, of Colorado, says Republicans likely have a 10-month window before any chance of major policy action is suffocated by next year’s midterms.\n“If we don’t get anything done by then, the elections probably don’t go very well,” Wright said.	COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -\n\nThe urgency was easy to find inside the private receptions and closed-door briefings at the Koch brothers’ donor retreat in Colorado Springs, where the billionaire conservatives and their chief lieutenants warned this weekend of a rapidly shrinking window to push their agenda through Congress.\n\nNo agenda items mattered more to the conservative Koch network than the GOP’s promise to overhaul the nation’s tax code and repeal and replace President Barack Obama’s health care law. At the moment, however, both are bogged down by GOP infighting that jeopardizes their fate.\n\n“There is urgency,” said Tim Phillips, who leads the network’s political arm, Americans for Prosperity. “We believe we have a window of about 12 months to get as much of it accomplished as possible before the 2018 elections grind policy to a halt.”\n\nThe window for action may be even smaller, some Koch allies warned at a weekend donor retreat that drew roughly 400 participants to the heart of the Rocky Mountains. The price for admission for most was a pledge to give at least $100,000 this year to the Kochs’ broad policy and political network. There were also at least 18 elected officials on hand. Some hosted private policy discussions with donors while others simply mingled.\n\nIn between meetings, Rep. Dave Brat, R-Virginia, predicted dire consequences in next year’s midterm elections should his party fail to deliver on its repeated promises.\n\n“If we don’t get health care, none of us are coming back,” he said in a brief interview. “We said for seven years you’re gonna repeal Obamacare. It’s nowhere near repealed.”\n\nIt’s the same for tax reform, Brat said: “We don’t get taxes through, we’re all going home. Pack the bags.”\n\nThere was a sense of deep frustration from conservative officials and donors alike in some cases, who decried the pace of progress in Washington with Republicans controlling both chambers of Congress and the White House for the first time in a decade.\n\nTexas-based donor Doug Deason has already informed a handful of congressional Republicans that the “Dallas piggy bank” is closed until he sees more action. He said he was recently approached by Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C. and Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, about hosting a fundraiser.\n\n“I said, ‘No I’m not going to because we’re closing the checkbook until you get some things done,’” Deason said, noting he’s encouraged nearly two dozen major Texas donors to follow his lead.\n\n“Get Obamacare repealed and replaced, get tax reform passed,” Deason continued. “Get it done and we’ll open it back up.”\n\nWhile some donors threatened to withhold campaign cash, Koch’s team outlined a broader strategy to help shape the debate.\n\nAlready, Americans For Prosperity claims a paid staff of more than 400 full-time activists in 36 states. Koch officials said that the network’s midterm budget for policy and politics is between $300 million and $400 million.\n\nThe group is actively lobbying Senate Republicans to change their current health care proposal, which it views as insufficiently conservative.\n\n“We are not committed to the Senate bill in its current form, but there is still time to make changes and we’re actively working to improve it,” Phillips said.\n\nAt the same time, Koch’s allies are aggressively pushing forward on the taxes. The network is running what it describes as “a first wave” of digital ads calling on more than 50 House and Senate Republicans in both parties to overhaul the nation’s tax code. Later in the summer, Philips said, Americans for Prosperity will begin hosting rallies and other events to generate momentum for a tax overhaul in all 36 states where they have full-time operations.\n\nSean Lansing, AFP’s chief operating officer, warned that the Republican Party’s House majority could be in jeopardy if the Republican-led Congress doesn’t follow through.\n\n“If they don’t make good on these promises…there are going to be consequences, and quite frankly there should be,” Lansing said.\n\nRepublicans would have to lose 24 seats to lose the House majority. And in a handful of recent special elections, the GOP has prevailed, despite President Donald Trump’s low approval ratings.\n\nAnother Koch donor, Chris Wright, of Colorado, says Republicans likely have a 10-month window before any chance of major policy action is suffocated by next year’s midterms.\n\n“If we don’t get anything done by then, the elections probably don’t go very well,” Wright said. “They may not go well anyway.”	2017-06-26 11:38:06.308069+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	6	719	['The Washington Times Http', 'Steve Peoples']

News of Heaney’s death came to Harrison when he was convalescing on the rocky precipices around Delphi, making his “coeval heart” judder “with lurches of scree fall.” Later in the poem he remembers Ted Hughes as well. Harrison is the only survivor out of these three post-war titans of poetry associated with regional dialects, and he shows no sign of moderating his radical politics, despite publishing prize-winning yet sometimes scandalously controversial poetry for more than half a century.\n\nOn 30th April he celebrated his 80th birthday, and he has faced serious obstacles over the last two decades.

Doug Fister is again pitching for Dave Dombrowski, a reunion between a pitcher and an executive with plenty of history.\n\nDombrowski made a number of big trades when he was with the Detroit Tigers, and two of them involved Fister. One came in 2011, when the Tigers acquired him from Seattle. The other was after the 2013 season, when Fister was dealt to Washington. Those deals had a significant impact on contending teams, and that’s what the Boston Red Sox - Dombrowski’s current employer - are hoping for after bringing in the 33-year-old starter to help an injury-plagued rotation.\n\n“It’s definitely a good feeling to get back out here,” Fister said after pitching six innings in Sunday’s 4-2 loss to the Los Angeles Angels. “I hold myself to a higher standard than what I had out there, so I’ve got some work to do.”\n\nThis was Fister’s first major league start of the season. The Red Sox claimed him off waivers this past week, in a move that underscored how much has changed for Fister since he was such a crucial part of three AL Central-winning teams in Detroit.\n\nIn 2011, Dombrowski acquired him from Seattle, with outfielder Casper Wells and left-hander Charlie Furbush going to the Mariners. It turned out to be a steal for the Tigers when Fister went 8-1 for them. He won 10 more games in 2012 and 14 in 2013, emerging as a dependable contributor in an excellent Detroit rotation.\n\nThen, Fister was dealt to the Nationals in a move that shocked many Detroit fans. The players the Tigers received - Robbie Ray, Ian Krol and Steve Lombardozzi - contributed little in Detroit, and Fister won 16 games with a 2.41 ERA his first season in Washington.\n\nThe deal was almost a total loss for the Tigers. Ray eventually became a promising starter - but in Arizona after Detroit traded him there.\n\nFister, meanwhile, is trying to revive his big league career after his effectiveness declined in 2015 and 2016. He went 12-13 with a 4.64 ERA for Houston last year, and he was released from a minor league contract with the Angels at his request last week. He hadn’t started in the majors since last September.\n\nThe trades involving Fister were two of Dombrowski’s most significant deals in Detroit. It remains to be seen whether this latest move has anything close to the same impact.\n\n“I thought he held his stuff really well through the entire time that he was on the mound,” Red Sox manager John Farrell said Sunday. “Good life to his fastball, good sink. Threw a number of good cutters. I thought he pitched in to both lefties and righties effectively. That was a very good start on the part of Doug today.”\n\nHere are a few other developments from around baseball:\n\nON A TEAR\n\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers are trying to overcome unexpected challenges from Arizona and Colorado in the NL West, but they lead the division by 2 ½ games after their 10th straight win Sunday. That was a wild 12-6 victory over the Rockies in which Colorado reliever Adam Ottavino threw four wild pitches.\n\nThe Dodgers and Houston Astros are both on pace to win at least 107 games.\n\nHIGHLIGHT\n\nJoey Gallo isn’t known for his speed, but the 6-foot-5 Texas Rangers third baseman legged out an inside-the-park home run Wednesday night in a 7-5 loss to Toronto. Gallo, who does have two triples this season, came around and scored easily when Blue Jays left fielder Steve Pearce crashed into the wall while chasing the deep fly ball.\n\nLINE OF THE WEEK\n\nWhile Cody Bellinger’s home run binge has received much of the attention, it was Los Angeles teammate Corey Seager who went deep three times as the Dodgers routed the New York Mets 12-0 on Tuesday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball\n\n___\n\nFollow Noah Trister at www.Twitter.com/noahtrister	2017-06-26 11:38:19.101909+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	6	722	['The Washington Times Http', 'Noah Trister']

As New York Rangers players cleaned out their lockers after a second-round playoff exit, all the talk was about impending change.\n\nThat’s just getting started - for the Rangers and the rest of the NHL.\n\nBig moves leading up to and at the draft by the Rangers, rival New York Islanders, Chicago Blackhawks and others set up a potentially crazy week to come going into free agency. Teams could begin talking to pending free agents Sunday and can sign them starting Saturday afternoon, and in between there could be plenty more movement now that the Vegas expansion draft is over and the foundation has been laid for trades.\n\n“Everyone had a lot of doubt moving into (the expansion draft) because they didn’t know who will be on their team,” Florida Panthers general manager Dale Tallon said. “I think more teams will be aggressive in that regard because they know what they have.”\n\nThe Golden Knights are expected to flip at least a couple more players selected in the expansion draft, the Islanders are looking for a No. 2 center and no one knows what the Panthers and Coyotes will do next. The Rangers cleared significant cap space by buying out Dan Girardi and trading Derek Stepan to Arizona and could take a run at defenseman Kevin Shattenkirk and other top free agents available.\n\n“The Rangers feel that we had some really good hockey teams, we were really close, but in order for them to take that extra step over the hump, they have to make some moves,” Stepan said.\n\nAfter the Pittsburgh Penguins won the Stanley Cup in back-to-back seasons, the Rangers aren’t alone in trying to keep up. While Shattenkirk, Montreal winger Alexander Radulov, Washington veteran Justin Williams and Pittsburgh defenseman Trevor Daley are among the top free agents available, players like Colorado’s Matt Duchene, Vegas’ Marc Methot or Montreal’s Alex Galchenyuk could be traded first and change the course of the market.\n\nHere are some things to watch for this week:\n\nACTIVE ISLANDERS\n\nNew York already acquired winger Jordan Eberle from Edmonton for Ryan Strome and traded defenseman Travis Hamonic to Calgary for picks, but no one believes Garth Snow is done. Captain John Tavares can be an unrestricted free agent in a year and Snow said he’d like the star center to retire with the Islanders - and there’s some work to do to get back into playoff contention.\n\nThat’s why Snow said it’s very possible the Islanders use draft picks they got from the Flames for Hamonic “as a currency in a future player transaction.” Duchene would fit the bill, but he won’t come cheap, and the Avalanche won’t have a shortage of suitors.\n\nCHANGING COYOTES\n\nWithin the past 10 days, Arizona has traded starting goaltender Mike Smith, told captain and face of the franchise Shane Doan they’re moving on, parted ways with coach Dave Tippett and traded for Stepan, Rangers backup Antti Raanta and Blackhawks defenseman Niklas Hjalmarsson. The youth movement is on for the Coyotes, but they haven’t made the playoffs since 2012 and new sole owner Andrew Barroway isn’t afraid to shake things up.\n\nThe only question is, what comes next? Arizona has roughly $25 million in cap space and can make some splashes with more deals or free agent signings.\n\nIT’S ALWAYS A GOALIE CONTROVERSY IN PHILADELPHIA\n\nThe goaltender carousel has stopped spinning after Carolina acquired Scott Darling, Dallas landed Ben Bishop, the Flames picked up Smith and the Coyotes got Raanta. That leaves the Philadelphia Flyers, no strangers to goaltending predicaments, as the only potential playoff contender in search of a starter.\n\nThe Flyers could run it back with Steve Mason and Michal Neuvirth, inquire with Vegas about 27-year-old Calvin Pickard or look to sign someone such as Jonathan Bernier, Ryan Miller, Brian Elliott or Mike Condon.\n\nRE-DO IN FLORIDA\n\nSince Tallon reassumed control of Florida’s front office, he has taken steps to undo a lot of what former GM Tom Rowe did last summer and put his own stamp back on the Panthers. Tallon cleared $5 million cap space by trading Reilly Smith to Vegas and said he’ll be “aggressive moving forward” and attack July 1 with a defined plan in place.\n\nPENGUINS MARCH ON\n\nChanges are afoot in Pittsburgh with goalie Marc-Andre Fleury already gone to Vegas and Daley, Nick Bonino, Chris Kunitz, Matt Cullen and Ron Hainsey set to be unrestricted free agents. With Justin Schultz and Conor Sheary among those needing new contracts, GM Jim Rutherford told free agents to test the market and come back to him, so the Penguins could look very different just three weeks after another Cup parade.\n\nSHATTENKIRK SHOULD GET PAID\n\nThe Capitals committed big money to winger T.J. Oshie with a $46 million, eight-year deal, but they’re unlikely to re-sign Shattenkirk, Williams, Karl Alzner and Daniel Winnik. Shattenkirk, 28, wants to be a No. 1 defenseman and is a good bet to sign the richest contract of any free agent Saturday.\n\n“I’ve kind of done it all and I want the opportunity to do it consistently,” Shattenkirk said. “I have to prove myself and get that opportunity and run with it, but hopefully it’s out there.”\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Tim Reynolds in Sunrise, Florida, contributed.\n\n___\n\nFollow Hockey Writer Stephen Whyno on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/SWhyno .\n\n___\n\nFor more AP NHL coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/NHLhockey	2017-06-26 11:38:20.28069+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	6	723	['The Washington Times Http', 'Stephen Whyno']

HARTLAND, Vt. (AP) - Each spring and summer, a Vermont bog yields a rare spectacle - hundreds of wild orchids in bloom, drawing visitors from around the country.\n\nThe bulbous pink and white showy lady’s slippers (Cypripedium reginae) are on full display among the ferns, bushes and chirping birds at Eshqua Bog in Hartland.\n\nThis particular orchid, considered rare in Vermont and a number of other states and different from the more common pink lady’s slipper, thrives in Eshqua, because of the wet, sunny conditions, with soils containing peat and lime.\n\nMary English drove about an hour from Landgrove, Vermont, to see the orchids on Thursday. When she arrived, she had the bog to herself.\n\n“I just wandered through by myself. It was very special. It’s like being in a South American country,” she said.\n\nA boardwalk allows visitors of all ages and abilities access to the bog and an up-close look at the plants.\n\n“Gosh, aren’t they beautiful?” said Heather Crawley, of Maryville, Tennessee, as she studiously photographed the orchids with a special lens on Thursday. “To think it’s natural, too.”\n\nVisitors can also walk a half-mile trail.\n\nThe area is technically a fen because it’s less acidic than a bog and fed by groundwater containing nutrients like calcium and magnesium from the area bedrock, according to the Nature Conservancy, which owns and manages the preserve along with the New England Wild Flower Society. The sanctuary includes an 8-acre (3.2-hectare) wetland and 33 surrounding acres (13.4 hectares).\n\nOther orchids also bloom, like yellow lady’s slipper in late May and early June and the white bog orchid around now.\n\nThe lime-rich groundwater also helps to yield pitcher plants, insectivorous sundew and other plants.\n\nBut the orchids are typically the main show for visitors.\n\n“The orchids love it at Eshqua, and people love to see the orchids,” said Rose Paul, of the Nature Conservancy.	2017-06-26 11:38:41.140732+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	6	728	['The Washington Times Http', 'Lisa Rathke']

GOLF\n\nCROMWELL, Conn. (AP) - Jordan Spieth needed an extra hole, a little bit of luck and an amazing final shot to finish off a wire-to-wire victory in the Travelers Championship.\n\nThe two-time major champion holed out from 60 feet for birdie from a greenside bunker on the first hole of a playoff with Daniel Berger on Sunday at TPC River Highlands.\n\nThe 23-year-old Texan joined Tiger Woods as the only PGA Tour players with 10 victories in the era since World War II. Woods won 15 times before he turned 24. Spieth held a one-stroke edge after each of the first three rounds. He closed with an even-par 70 to match Berger - who birdied three of the final six holes for a 67 - at 12-under 268.\n\nBerger, the Memphis winner two weeks ago before missing the cut last week at the U.S. Open, just missed a 50-foot putt from off the 18th green left that would have forced a second playoff hole.\n\nROGERS, Ark.

(AP) - Kevin Harvick returned to victory lane for the first time this season with a dominating run Sunday on the road course at Sonoma Raceway.\n\nThe former NASCAR champion came to Sonoma winless in 20 races since Kansas last fall and has been overshadowed in this season of NASCAR’s young new superstars. But at a track where experience and ability can separate the field, it was Harvick and a bunch of veterans who led the way.\n\nIt was the first win on the winding wine country road course in 17 tries for the Bakersfield, California, driver. Sonoma was one of just four active tracks where Harvick had never before scored a Cup victory.\n\nHarvick was on cruise control and conserving fuel in this win, which ended under caution after Kasey Kahne had a hard accident on the final lap.\n\nBAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) - Red Bull driver Daniel Ricciardo profited from the chaos to win the Azerbaijan Grand Prix on Sunday, while Sebastian Vettel extended his championship lead over Lewis Hamilton.\n\nThe Australian secured his fifth career win, while Mercedes driver Valtteri Bottas overtook 18-year-old Canadian Lance Stroll’s Williams in the closing meters to take second place.\n\nVettel steered his Ferrari into fourth, just ahead of Hamilton’s Mercedes.\n\nIn a stop-start race, the safety car came out three times in quick succession before a red flag stopped the race near the midway point because debris littered the track.

The 29-year-old Tebow led the University of Florida to two national championships and won the 2007 Heisman Trophy during his stellar football career with the Gators.\n\nBaseball has not been as easy for the 29-year-old outfielder. He hit just .220 with three homers and 23 RBIs with Class A Columbia - numbers that usually don’t lead to a promotion.\n\n“For me, it’s not something I have to answer,” Tebow said. “There’s a lot smarter, wiser people than me that make those decisions. I just try and show up and play hard every day.”\n\nGeneral manager Sandy Alderson announced the move before the Mets’ 8-2 win at San Francisco on Sunday. He said Tebow’s performance had trended positively the past two or three weeks and the Mets thought it was a good time for his promotion.\n\nMIAMI (AP) - Manager Don Mattingly made out the Miami Marlins’ lineup unaware he was making Ichiro Suzuki the oldest player to start a game in center field since at least 1900.\n\n“He doesn’t play like that,” said Mattingly, who learned of the achievement after the game.\n\nWhen the 43-year-old Suzuki started in Sunday’s 4-2 win over the Chicago Cubs, he surpassed the record held by Hall of Famer Rickey Henderson, who was a month younger when he started in center in 2002 for the Boston Red Sox.\n\nSuzuki went 0 for 4, dropping his average to .200, but reached on an error and scored in the first inning, and had four putouts in center.

(AP) - Nick D’Virgilio has a sore back.\n\nThe drummer at Sweetwater Sound isn’t trying to conceal it, either. When he stands, he arches backward and puts both hands behind his waist, the way old people do when they roll out of bed and stretch. Walking toward the company’s nearly football field-size cafeteria in a black T-shirt and jeans, he says he’s 48, “but my back feels like I’m 68 right now.”\n\nIt is Monday morning at Sweetwater. Warm outside. Hot, actually. In the spacious front lobby, a group of students gathers around the now-famous two-tone Volkswagen minibus. They listen as the tour guide tells the familiar bus-to-business success story - of how founder Chuck Surack started the company from this very vehicle almost 40 years ago and turned it into a musical empire.\n\nNot content with being one of the world’s largest retail distributors of instruments, Sweetwater evolved into other interests and resources: in-store merchandise, a musical academy for students, state-of-the-art recording studios with professional in-house musicians. And this is where Nick D’Virgilio entered the Sweetwater team picture nearly three years ago.\n\nLet’s back up, first.\n\nWhen his jet-black hair was a little longer and his two-day stubble not as white, D’Virgilio helped form the Los Angeles progressive rock group called Spock’s Beard and was with it for almost 20 years, from 1992 until he left in 2010 as its lead singer. During that time, Spock’s Beard - the name’s a takeoff on a “Star Trek” episode - recorded 10 albums.\n\nBecause the group recorded sporadically, D’Virgilio sought more work and was hired to play with British pop-rock band Tears for Fears, from 1995 to 2010. There were earlier gigs, too. He was recruited to play with Genesis, after Phil Collins left, and played on the album “Calling All Stations.” He’s also played with Sheryl Crow, Peter Gabriel, Eric Burdon and the Animals and Mike Keneally; and many, many others who knew of his reputation and wanted him in their studio.\n\nBut in 2011 came the Godfather offer - one he couldn’t refuse - to join Cirque du Soleil’s “Totem” tour as its drummer, lead singer and assistant bandleader.\n\n“I was part of a huge rock show every night. The whole kit and caboodle; lights and smoke and the huge stage and the P.A.,” he says. “It was a very cool job.” In 2013, the show won the New York Drama Desk Award for Unique Theatrical Experience.\n\nNot only would he see the world, but so would his wife, Tiffany, and their children Anthony and Sophia.\n\n“They housed my family, schooled my kids, the whole nine yards,” D’Virgilio says. “All you had to do was pay for your kids and your family to get from A to B. You got the apartment, the whole thing. It was a fantastic benefit.\n\n“But they cut that (benefit), and that was my ticket out. I could’ve kept my job, but I would’ve had to home-school the kids in Australia and pay for their housing. It wasn’t very realistic, especially for high school-age kids. So I was looking for a job.”\n\nBecause the music world is a small one, it’s always good to know somebody. That somebody was Nashville producer/recording engineer Mark Hornsby, whom Sweetwater hired five years ago to inject new blood and fresh ideas into its studio development. Since Sweetwater was bringing in top-tier musicians, and word got out that D’Virgilio was looking, it was a match made in Fort Wayne.\n\nIn the three years away from the hotels, motels and sideshows of “the road,” his world has been as steady as his drumbeat.\n\nTiffany has a job at Lutheran Hospital as a nuclear medicine technologist. Sophia, 19, recently graduated from Homestead High School and will soon be headed to Indiana University in Bloomington to study radiation therapy. Anthony, 17, will be a senior at Homestead. Both kids love the theater. Tiffany loves her three horses.\n\nWhich brings us back to D’Virgilio’s back.\n\n“I was moving hay,” he says. “Stacking hay. They (the horses) got to eat, and they do that quite a bit. It’s a lot of work. Luckily, my neighbor down the street has an enormous barn and he stores most of it, but it was time to get out the old and bring in the new. That’s what I did (Sunday). It was fine while I was doing it. It’s the after-effects that’s kicking my butt right now.”\n\nThankfully, his Monday schedule was a light one. A local guitar player was in Studio A, working on a song, which gave D’Virgilio time to talk and stretch a bit.\n\nHe spends most days doing studio sessions and appearing in web videos for drum products whose makers would love to have the Sweetwater seal of approval. That’s him, playing and selling and talking up the product. “I get to make records and play with gear all day long,” he says.\n\nDon’t misinterpret his day-to-day contentment. D’Virgilio stresses that he’s not Mr. Nine-to-Five. He’s the guy wearing the black T-shirt, remember, and not a Windsor knot, and that he’s still active in a few bands.\n\nThere’s the progressive rock group called Big Big Train that’s doing well on the U.K. charts and just released a new album in April called “Grimspound.” And he’s with the rock trio The Fringe “to make something new,” according to its Facebook page.\n\nMeanwhile, if the phone rings, he’s up for some freelance. In September, he says, he’ll be in England. He’s also been offered to play in a drum festival “in Romania, of all places.”\n\nBad back and all, D’Virgilio says he’s still a rocker, and not necessarily ready to sit in one.\n\n“It’s different,” he says. “I miss the road. I miss playing every night for my only job. I play here quite a bit, but not like that. I do miss it. I don’t know if I will ever not miss it.\n\n“I’m totally playing it by ear,” says D’Virgilio, unaware, perhaps, of the double meaning. “I’m taking advantage of this job, which has given me lots of cool opportunities, and growing in the company and growing in this field.”\n\nHe is still L.A.-hypnotic hip. It’s where he’s from. Where Tiffany is from. Where the parents live, where the kids were small, where he coached little league and hoops, where his beloved Dodgers play. Now look at him - the SoCal boy who has a place near Roanoke, of all places.\n\nIndiana winters aside, he’s adjusting. Seriously.\n\n“In the three years I’ve been here, this town has exploded,” he says of Fort Wayne. “It’s growing like crazy. There’s a lot of cool and - quote-unquote - very hip things that are coming to town as far as food, venues, music. There’s a lot of stuff going on in this city that I never would have expected.\n\n“I told my wife, ‘So, you want to move to Fort Wayne, Indiana?’ And she says there’s no way we’re moving to Fort Wayne, Indiana. She’ll tell you now it’s one of the best decisions we’ve ever made. It’s one of the cool towns. It’s got so much going for it - Sweetwater being one of them - and it seems like a town that wants to push the envelope and grow, which is a cool thing for me. There are a lot of musicians in this town; a lot of art I never would have expected. Theater. All kinds of stuff going on.”\n\nAnd that ain’t hay.\n\n___\n\nSource: The (Fort Wayne) Journal Gazette, http://bit.ly/2sJELqn\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Journal Gazette, http://www.journalgazette.net	2017-06-26 11:39:09.035756+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	6	731	['The Washington Times Http', 'Steve Warden']

BRYAN, Texas (AP) - A soldier standing beside a landscape of dark and menacing colors. An intricate, interactive piece about a murder with a cryptic, decodable message. A painting containing the words, “I hate fish tacos.”\n\nThe Eagle reports these pieces and more - created by Texas veterans - will line the walls of Downtown Bryan’s The Village Cafe & Art 979 from now until July 16.\n\nThe collection is the Eighth Annual Distinguished Artist Veteran exhibit for VSA Texas, an Austin-based arts and disability organization that has been hosting programs specifically geared toward veterans since 2009.\n\n“Art is a healing component for a lot of veterans,” said Janelle Matous, development director of VSA Texas. “They really feel it’s a part of their healing process.”\n\nThe program - this year’s is called “The Re-integration Project” - is a collection of writings, music and art. The nonprofit hosted a series of writing classes from late 2016 to early 2017, creating a 100-page book filled with poems, short stories and screenplays written by 13 veteran writers. VSA Texas then put out a call for veteran artists and songwriters to respond to pieces of writing produced in the class. The result was even more art for The Re-integration Project. Now, the text and accompanying artistic renderings line The Village’s walls, and the music can be listened to online.\n\nJudy King, one of the featured artists who responded to a piece of text, said she had been immediately inspired from the selected reading she chose to depict in a finger painting.\n\n“I started getting images through the first paragraph,” she said, describing the pictures her head started imagining while reading “The Absence Inside,” written by Barbara A. Malone-Verduin.\n\nKing, who served in the Air Force in Phoenix from 1975-79, said the colors and patterns “came to me as I was reading.”\n\nKing said she creates art as “a de-stressing kind of thing” that she can “get lost in.”\n\nDouglas Meredith, who served in the Navy from 1975-79 - stationed in places such as Key West and Los Angeles, places he sarcastically called a “real rough duty” - produced multiple pieces for the exhibit, among them the “Fish Tacos” and interactive pieces mentioned above, as well as a screenplay.\n\nMeredith’s artistic process involves meticulous research, contrasting with King’s “paint is as I see it” approach. But each veteran’s piece is striking in the impression left on the viewer and the interpretation of the corresponding text.\n\nMeredith said much of his art is inspired by the struggle for human rights and out of concern for the environment. He recently went to Standing Rock to support those who protested the Dakota Access Pipeline, where he was struck with a rubber bullet - which he called more “frozen” than rubber, considering the cold - that knocked him off his feet.\n\nMeredith said he saw a connection between the struggle for human rights, environmental sustainability and his representation of those struggles on the canvas.\n\n“I hope to make some kind of statement,” he said. “I see a lot of work coming ahead.”\n\nSome artists were at The Village on a recent Thursday night to perform music and talk about their pieces at an artist showcase, traveling to Bryan from across Central Texas.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Eagle, http://www.theeagle.com	2017-06-26 11:39:10.034674+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	6	732	['The Washington Times Http', 'Kelan Lyons']

The 2017 BET Awards had stumbles, from technical problems during a performance to going well over its planned three-and-a-half hour time slot during the live show held Sunday in Los Angeles. But the show’s performances and special moments made up for having to stay up late on a Sunday.\n\nCHANCE’S GOOD WORK\n\nAt the tender age of 24, Chance the Rapper was honored as a humanitarian during the BET Awards on Sunday for his work in his hometown of Chicago, with accolades from the Obamas to Kendrick Lamar.\n\nFormer First Lady Michelle Obama delivered a taped message for the rapper, saying he was an “outstanding role model” she and her husband, former President Barack Obama, had known since he was a “wee little baby rapper.” Lamar gave him a shout-out later on as well, saying Chance was just getting started.\n\nChance acknowledged that the honor felt early in his young career. But he said, “My God doesn’t make mistakes. And I like to think he puts this immense pressure on me to see how I react. “\n\nHis wide-ranging speech, which he said was off the cuff, called out several institutions, including the federal government, the Chicago public school system and the judicial system.

1091	FBI report shows Barrow gang stole suits in Fort Smith			http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jun/26/fbi-report-shows-barrow-gang-stole-suits-in-fort-s/	\N	FORT SMITH, Ark.\n“Maybe they did steal the suits in Fort Smith,” Knight wrote in an email.\n“In the meantime (sic) Clyde Barrow had bought a Brownie Camera for Bonnie Parker and just at the edge of North Carolina, Clyde Barrow, Bonnie Parker and himself took pictures.\nAlthough there is not a 1933 Fort Smith city directory at the Fort Smith Public Library, the 1930 and 1936 directories show five tailors working in Fort Smith - Mrs. Hattie Carl, 518½ Garrison Ave.; S.C. Cohn, 705 Garrison Ave.; L.M.\nThis was just one of many references in the FBI files to the Fort Smith area.	FORT SMITH, Ark. (AP) - Clyde Barrow and W.D. Jones most likely were wearing suits stolen from a Fort Smith tailor in those photographs that became known as the “Joplin rolls,” capturing the nation’s attention on the front pages of newspapers following a deadly April 1933 shootout with police in Joplin, Missouri.\n\nJeff Hill, a Fort Smith-based truck driver, saw two mentions of the stolen suits in extensive Federal Bureau of Investigation digital files on Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow while doing volunteer research for the Fort Smith Museum of History. Hill recently approached the Times Record with information on the suits after seeing an article last month that recalled the tragic June 1933 death of Alma City Marshal Henry Humphrey on U.S. 71 at the hands of “Buck” Barrow with Jones riding “shotgun.”\n\nThe Times Record (http://bit.ly/2rWwEV5 ) reports that William Daniel Jones, Bonnie and Clyde’s 17-year-old sidekick, had been captured by police in the fall of 1933 after nearly a year on the run with the infamous duo. While speaking to FBI Special Agents E.J. Dowd and C.B. Winstead at the Dallas Division Office from Dec. 6-7, 1933, about the automobiles he and the Barrows had stolen, Jones made an off-the-cuff remark that he and Clyde Barrow “‘stuck up’ a tailor shop early in the morning at Ft. Smith.”\n\n“Clyde took a blue suit which he used himself and gave Jones the suit with the wide stripe throwing the other six suits away,” the FBI report states. “The negatives of the photographs in question, according to Jones, were left behind together with his striped suit at Joplin, Missouri, after Clyde Barrow, Buck Barrow (deceased) and himself got into a shooting match with the officers at Joplin.”\n\nJones identified himself to the FBI agents in photographs with Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker that were taken with a camera Jones said was bought “at the edge of North Carolina” on a trip to Durham, North Carolina.\n\nWhether the photos were taken on the trip to North Carolina, or in Oklahoma, or Missouri, remains in question. The terrain in the background ranges from wooded flatland to rocky, mountainous terrain.\n\nJames R. Knight, an Alma native and author of “Bonnie and Clyde: A 21st Century Update,” is cautious on the Fort Smith connection to the suits and pointed out that not all of the information in the FBI files, including Jones‘ testimony, is completely credible.\n\n“Maybe they did steal the suits in Fort Smith,” Knight wrote in an email. “Certainly wouldn’t be out of character. Both Clyde and Bonnie liked to dress up and have nice clothes.”\n\nBrad Belk, executive director of the Joplin Historical & Mineral Museum, said he certainly wouldn’t put it past them.\n\n“That’s how they made their life,” Belk said. “They stole everything and paid for little. They liked to be well-dressed.”\n\nBelk said a good resource for him on the Bonnie and Clyde saga has been Jeff Guinn’s book “Go Down Together: The True, Untold Story of Bonnie and Clyde.” Guinn writes about the outlaws’ connection to Fort Smith in several pages of the book, Belk noted.\n\nAs for the trip to North Carolina to see the Camel plant - again, maybe so or maybe not, Knight says. The car in the famous photographs, however, was a V8 sport sedan with leather upholstery and a khaki top with the 1933 Texas plate 587-956. It was in their possession for about 30 days, mid-March to just after the Joplin shootout on April 13, 1933. According to the car’s owner, Bob Roseborough of Marshall, Texas, Bonnie and Clyde put about 3,000 miles on it, Knight added.\n\n“Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker and Jones traveled in this sport Sedan to Durham, North Carolina, where Clyde Barrow said he was going to see the Camel Cigarette Factory,” the FBI report states. “In the meantime (sic) Clyde Barrow had bought a Brownie Camera for Bonnie Parker and just at the edge of North Carolina, Clyde Barrow, Bonnie Parker and himself took pictures. Jones identified a photograph of himself sitting at the wheel of this sport Sedan, smoking a cigarette.”\n\nKnight said he has always thought the pictures were taken somewhere in northeast Oklahoma or southwest Missouri. The Barrows and Jones were certainly back in northeast Oklahoma by March 29-30, since they had met up with Buck and Blanche Barrow there. The FBI report put that meeting Checotah, Oklahoma. They all then went to Joplin, and by April 1, 1933, had rented an apartment there.\n\nKnight surmises the suits were probably stolen from the Fort Smith tailor no later than mid-March. There are credible reports of the Barrows in Texas until the end of December 1932 and early January.\n\nAlthough there is not a 1933 Fort Smith city directory at the Fort Smith Public Library, the 1930 and 1936 directories show five tailors working in Fort Smith - Mrs. Hattie Carl, 518½ Garrison Ave.; S.C. Cohn, 705 Garrison Ave.; L.M. Davila, Four S. Sixth St.; C.A. Wernich, 12 Court St.; and B.A. Wolfe, 26 N. Sixth St.\n\nHill has long felt it was C.A. Wernich on Court Street who was robbed of the suits, partially based on a 1947 obituary of Carl Albert Wernich that said he sold suits to “businessmen and bank robbers,” Hill said. However, Hill was also able to contact a relative of Wernich’s in Los Angeles and was told that the tailor was known to go into work very early in the morning and was “prideful,” so he may not have even reported it to the police.\n\nAccording to the Court Street address, Wernich’s tailor shop would have been in an alley next to the Hotel Main, which abutted First National Bank of Fort Smith. A Cohen Tailor shop, not Cohn as noted in the directory, had also been located in the west wing of the Main Hotel, as seen in a 1909 Southwest Times Record photo of the hotel made available by a donation from Joan Wade to the UAFS Pebley Center.\n\nThe photographs taken of Jones with Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow, according to Jones in the FBI memo, were from undeveloped rolls of film left behind in a two-story garage-apartment at 3347½ Oak Ridge Drive in Joplin. Police thought they were just raiding a bootlegger’s house. The Joplin shootout and escape cost Jones a bullet in the side, and his wide stripe suit.\n\nOne of Belk’s favorite tidbits of trivia related to the shootout is that Blanche Barrow’s little white dog, Snowball, ran off during the brief shootout. The Joplin museum has several artifacts from that day, including necklaces and a door from the apartment with bullet holes. They also have several reproduction photographs from the “Joplin rolls.” Knight pointed out the Joplin Globe newspaper developed the rolls of film for police.\n\nThe photos that would help other law agencies identify the suspects included the now-iconic image of Bonnie Parker holding a sawed-off shotgun on Clyde Barrow while she reaches for a revolver tucked in his belt. Other photos in that set were of Clyde with his arsenal of stolen guns and Jones in that wide-striped suit, his belt buckle cocked over to his right hip.\n\nBack on the road, Hill doesn’t have much time to research the Bonnie and Clyde saga anymore. His six-month hiatus from trucking because of a medical condition more than two years ago was filled with weeks at the library researching the duo’s path.\n\nAs Hill has noticed, a casual scanning of the FBI files on Bonnie and Clyde will uncover possible evidence of regular visits for the trio in west central Arkansas\n\nAlthough a Rand McNally’s map helped, apparently they knew the back roads well enough to successfully escape the extensive manhunt after the late June 1933 shootout at Alma.\n\nAs part of the FBI’s investigation into Bonnie and Clyde, a request was sent to the Arkansas State Highway Commission in July 1933 for information on Arkansas license plate 61-132. It was found in an abandoned car assumed to have been stolen by the Barrows. The response from the Arkansas Department of Revenues said the license plate belonged to Maurice Harvey of Waldron. It went on his 1931 Plymouth.\n\nThis was just one of many references in the FBI files to the Fort Smith area. Another document uncovered by Hill is a May 3, 1933, letter from Scott County Sheriff and Ex-Officio Collector Theo Money to Ed Portley, chief of detectives for the Joplin, Missouri, police department. Money was responding to a May 2 “circulars and description of the parties that owned the Springfield (sic) rifle.”\n\nIn the letter, Money tells Portley that Alva Hall, who lives about 18 miles southeast of Waldron “on the highway that goes to Hot Springs” reported that around March 1 “two men accompanied with one woman came his home and told him they had information that they could purchase some whiskey from him, and while they were there one of them noticed his rifle hanging on the wall and they began to try to trade for same.”\n\nThe letter goes on to say: “They traded him a 22 caliber high power and gave him $7.50 in money … They were in a coupe and he is not certain just what make it was but said it was equipped with a radio. They also advised him that they lived in DeQueen, Arkansas.”\n\nMoney also points out that Hall went to the game warden on the first of April and told him “he had traded his gun off and forgot to take his hunting license out of the stock.”\n\nKnight says these accounts fall in among hundreds from both the public and law enforcement - “intriguing” but probably not provable.” Much like the days after the ivory-billed woodpecker was reported in east Arkansas in 2004 after it was thought to be extinct for many years, Bonnie and Clyde sightings were reported every day throughout the Southwest after the Joplin shootout.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Southwest Times Record, http://www.swtimes.com/	2017-06-26 11:39:30.70669+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	6	736	['The Washington Times Http', 'John Lovett']

1096	Oolitic’s Empire Quarry considered ‘source of pride’			http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jun/26/oolitics-empire-quarry-considered-source-of-pride/	\N	On Wednesday, the Lawrence County Tourism Commission hosted a tour of Indiana Limestone Co.’s facility and Empire Quarry in Oolitic.\nFor Rizzo, it was his first quarry tour.\n“I liked seeing the cutting of the stones, and all the equipment.”The Empire Quarry has been in operation for more than 80 years.\n“My grandfather, Thomas Abel, was head blacksmith for Indiana Limestone back in the 1920s and 1930s.\n… We have a real history here.”A sense of pride was felt by some people as they overlooked the operation at Empire Quarry.	OOLITIC, Ind. (AP) - While limestone mining isn’t exactly a foreign concept to many Lawrence County residents, it’s not something out-of-state folks see every day.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Lawrence County Tourism Commission hosted a tour of Indiana Limestone Co.’s facility and Empire Quarry in Oolitic. The company has produced limestone used for the Empire State Building in New York, the Pentagon and Yankee Stadium.\n\nMary Duerksen, an Ann Arbor, Michigan, resident who was visiting her daughter, Kelsey, of Bloomington, said she’s fallen in love with Indiana, so the tour seemed like a good way to learn about the state’s important limestone history.\n\n“I thought this would be a great opportunity,” Duerksen said. “I just never understood the whole concept (of limestone), as we don’t really do a lot of mining in Michigan. My only reference was ‘Breaking Away.’ It’s so amazing how they handle it back here, and it was amazing to see (Empire Quarry).”\n\nTom Rizzo, a Long Island, New York, resident who was also visiting family in Indiana, brought his grandson Maksim along for the tour. For Rizzo, it was his first quarry tour. Like Duerksen, he wasn’t too familiar with limestone history.\n\n“We’ve enjoyed seeing all this,” Rizzo said. “I liked seeing the cutting of the stones, and all the equipment.”\n\nThe Empire Quarry has been in operation for more than 80 years. Indiana Limestone has about 4,500 acres of property between Lawrence and Monroe counties. The company estimates it has about 150 years of known limestone reserves.\n\nThe tour also played into various interests of the attendees. Some, especially those who grew up in the area, noted the nostalgia of the tour.\n\nPaula Patton, a Bloomington resident, said it was nice to see a quarry “with permission” this time, alluding to the popularity of using quarries as a swimming hole. The practice is dangerous and is generally considered trespassing.\n\n“I’m a Hoosier … I swam in the quarries growing up,” Patton said. “It’s great coming back here with permission. I could do this all day long.”\n\nFor Gene Abel, a Lawrence County resident who has been working to restore limestone works in the Green Hill Cemetery, the tour made him think about his family’s connections to the limestone industry. He’s been on tours, but it was his first time on a tour of the Indiana Limestone Co.’s modern Oolitic operations.\n\n“It’s been enjoyable and it’s educational for me to see all these changes,” Abel said. “My grandfather, Thomas Abel, was head blacksmith for Indiana Limestone back in the 1920s and 1930s. And my dad was a blacksmith after him. … It was a big business back then, but now it’s modernized. That’s what happens, though. … We have a real history here.”\n\nA sense of pride was felt by some people as they overlooked the operation at Empire Quarry. Lloyd Harry, from Evansville, said he visited quarries in Italy about five years ago, but there’s an extra sense of pride at a more local one.\n\n“It’s some cool stuff,” Harry said. “The limestone’s been used for the state capitols, the Pentagon, the (Washington) National Cathedral … that’s definitely a source of pride.”\n\n___\n\nSource: The (Bedford) Times-Mail, http://bit.ly/2rZ47Dm\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Times-Mail, http://www.tmnews.com	2017-06-26 11:39:47.294782+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	6	741	['The Washington Times Http', 'Derrek Tipton']

SPINDALE, N.C. (AP) - For two years, Matthew Fenner said he pleaded with authorities to investigate his allegations that a group of fellow congregants at the Word of Faith Fellowship church had punched, slapped and choked him to expel his “homosexual demons.”\n\nAn Associated Press investigation found that Rutherford County investigators and then-District Attorney Brad Greenway delayed investigating and told Fenner his only option was to pursue misdemeanor charges against the church members he said assaulted him for nearly two hours in the evangelical church’s sanctuary.\n\nThe AP’s conclusions are based on more than a dozen interviews, court documents and secretly made recordings that were provided of Fenner’s meetings with law enforcement authorities, including Rutherford County Sheriff Chris Francis.\n\nIn February, the AP detailed how many Word of Faith Fellowship congregants were regularly attacked both physically and verbally in an attempt to “purify” sinners by beating out devils.\n\nThe church has come under scrutiny by law enforcement and social services authorities on numerous occasions with little effect, mostly because followers refused to cooperate. But Fenner’s relentless pursuit eventually led to the indictment of five congregants, who were charged with kidnapping and assault.\n\n“The whole investigation should have taken a month,” said Michael Davis, who spent 15 years as a Rutherford County sheriff’s investigator before retiring last year, and was not involved in the Fenner case.\n\nGreenway said he couldn’t recall details of the Fenner case, but initially believed it wasn’t a “big deal” based on what he said the sheriff told him. Francis said Greenway made the decision not to pursue charges early on.\n\nIn May, longtime minister Brooke Covington became the first of the five church members to go on trial in proceedings that attracted national attention due to the AP’s investigation.\n\nA mistrial was declared during jury deliberations. Covington will be tried again Sept. 11.\n\nDuring the trial, Fenner, now 24, testified that he didn’t call police the night of the Jan. 27, 2013, attack because he was afraid and was living with Covington at the time. When Fenner fled to his grandparents two days later, they called authorities.\n\nThe AP found that Fenner not only told local and federal law enforcement agencies what happened to him, but also warned of larger ongoing abuse.\n\nWord of Faith Fellowship was founded in 1979 by Jane Whaley, a former math teacher, and her husband, Sam. It has grown from a handful of followers to a congregation of about 750 in North Carolina and nearly 2,000 members in churches in Brazil, Ghana and affiliations in Sweden, Scotland and other countries.\n\nFenner initially talked to a Rutherford County sheriff’s deputy the day after fleeing the church, but wasn’t ready to press charges.\n\n“I was still confused and hurt. I needed time to think,” he told the AP.\n\nBut on Jan. 31, 2013, he met with FBI agent Fred Molina, who was investigating a complaint from another congregant who said he was beaten because he was gay. Fenner detailed what happened to him, along with the abuse of other congregants, six people told the AP.\n\nWhen he received a letter months later saying the FBI wasn’t going to investigate, he said he was told it was because the other church member had recanted.\n\nThe FBI referred questions to the Charlotte office of U.S. Attorney Jill Rose, who said Fenner’s allegations did not meet the requirements of a federal crime.\n\nFenner said he talked to sheriff’s detective Joey Sisk about the assault on June 7, 2013, and pressed Sisk for updates for months.\n\nOn an October 2013 recording obtained by the AP, Sisk said Greenway read Fenner’s statement and decided no criminal charges would be pursued. Sisk told Fenner that his only recourse would be trying to file misdemeanor charges with the local magistrate, which experts say rarely works.\n\nFenner met in January 2014 with Rose, then an assistant U.S. attorney in Charlotte, hoping to get help under a federal hate crimes law. On a tape obtained by the AP, Fenner and four supporters told Rose about the abuse.\n\nRose, who was once an assistant prosecutor in a district that included the church, told the group that she would think about her next step, but Fenner said she did not return any follow-up calls.\n\nRose told the AP that the assault Fenner described did not fully meet the requirements of the federal hate crimes statute for sexual orientation because there was no element of interstate commerce, or movement of across state lines.\n\nFenner had been repeatedly pressing for meetings with Greenway and Francis, the sheriff, and finally landed a meeting with Francis in August 2014.\n\n“I have not looked at one thing in your case file,” the sheriff said in a recording of the meeting, adding that Greenway had “personally reviewed” the allegations and decided not to prosecute.\n\nAfter camping outside his office, Fenner met with Greenway in October with five family members and friends. When the group told Greenway that both Francis and Sisk earmarked him as the one who declined to prosecute, Greenway responded that he didn’t know details of the case because he hadn’t seen an incident report.\n\nIn an interview with the AP this February, Greenway said he could not recall much about Fenner’s complaint. “The sheriff told me early on it was not a felony kidnapping case,” he said, though Francis disputed that characterization.\n\nIn the interview, Greenway called the church influential and said its accusers weren’t always reliable. “You just got tired going against them,” he said.\n\nIn December 2014, a month after Greenway lost his re-election bid, a grand jury indicted the five Word of Faith members.\n\n“If it wasn’t for our pressure,” said Fenner’s aunt, Lynn Rape, “nothing would have happened.”\n\n___\n\nMohr reported from Jackson, Mississippi.\n\n___\n\nRead more of AP’s investigation of the Word of Faith Fellowship here: http://apne.ws/2lmuzDA\n\n___\n\nThe AP National Investigative Team can be reached at investigate@ap.org	2017-06-26 11:39:48.272574+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	6	742	['The Washington Times Http', 'Mitch Weiss', 'Holbrook Mohr']

ABERDEEN, S.D. (AP) - Wearing lime green gloves and a pink flower in her braids, Grayce Comes thoughtfully draws a smiley face underneath a quote that reads “B you!” on the sidewalk in front of her house.\n\nFor the past two months, the 11-year-old artist has been encouraging her Aberdeen neighborhood - along Jay Street north of the Northern State University campus - one cement slab at a time, the Aberdeen News (http://bit.ly/2rSUeCl ) reported.\n\nGrayce realized her sidewalk chalk could be used to brighten people’s days and created “Artopia,” originally called “Artlandia,” a “blog” that exists on the sidewalk in front of her home.\n\n“If you walk by it in the morning, it’ll encourage you,” she said. “People can look and also learn.”\n\nGrayce said her best friend and her little brother also help with the chalk art, writing favorite quotes such as, “It’s never impossible, just challenging.” She said she also enjoys writing song lyrics and “things I’ve learned over the years.\n\n“They’re always encouraging,” she said. “Never negative.”\n\nGrayce said she wants to sell her art in the future and be an art teacher when she grows up.\n\nBrad Comes, Grayce’s father, said the young artist has been drawing with chalk every summer for years.\n\n“She’s probably been doing it since she was old enough to know how to handle a piece of chalk,” he said. “She . took hold and started using each slab of the sidewalk as its own canvas.”\n\nGrayce has an aversion to conflict or negativity, her father said, and “doesn’t want bullying to be in existence.”\n\nHe said when he first saw Grayce’s chalk drawings and positive messages, he was blown away - even though some of the words were misspelled.

NEW YORK (AP) - “Pharma Bro” just won’t keep his mouth shut.\n\nEven with his federal securities fraud trial set to begin Monday, Martin Shkreli has blatantly defied his attorneys’ advice to lay low. The former pharmaceutical CEO, who became a pariah after raising the cost of a life-saving drug 5,000 percent, has been preening for cameras and trolling on social media, potentially complicating his defense.\n\n“I’m excited,” Shkreli said of the trial in a brief phone call last week to The Associated Press. “I can’t wait.”\n\nSince his high-profile arrest in late 2015 when he was led into court in a gray hoodie, Shkreli has been free on bail and free to speak his mind. He went on Twitter to label members of Congress “imbeciles” for demanding to know why his company, Turing Pharmaceuticals, raised the price of Daraprim, a drug used to treat toxoplasmosis and HIV, from $13.50 to $750 per pill.\n\nHe took to YouTube for a series of lessons on chemistry and stock market analysis. His Twitter posts mocking a freelance journalist turned so creepy - one showed a fake photo of him canoodling with her - that his account was shut down. And on Facebook, he mused about the possibility of being “unjustly imprisoned.”\n\nThe 34-year-old Shkreli “travels to the beat of a very unique drummer,” exasperated-sounding defense attorney Benjamin Brafman said at a pretrial hearing this month.\n\nLegal experts say there are obvious reasons lawyers want clients facing serious criminal charges to keep quiet.\n\n“It’s twofold: You don’t want to antagonize the judge and you don’t want to get the attention of the jury in a way that hurts your case,” said veteran New York City defense attorney Gerald Lefcourt.\n\nColumbia law professor John Coffee compared the situation to President Donald Trump’s unruly tweeting habits. “A lawyer can caution him,” he said. “But just like Trump, he doesn’t have to listen.”\n\nThough Shkreli’s notoriety came from Daraprim, the federal securities fraud case is unrelated. Prosecutors say that after Shkreli lost millions of dollars through bad trades through his side business hedge fund, he looted a second pharmaceutical company for $11 million to pay them back. The defense has argued that he had good intentions.\n\n“Everybody got paid back in this case,” his lawyer said. “Whatever else he did wrong, he ultimately made them whole.”\n\nThe defense has floated the possibility that it would put Shkreli on the witness stand to try to highlight how he grew up in a working-class Albanian family in Brooklyn, taught himself chemistry, interned at a financial firm founded by CNBC’s Jim Cramer and struck out on his own to become a rising star in biotechnology startups. He wanted to develop new life-saving drugs after seeing “several classmates and other children he knew struck down by debilitating disease,” court papers say.\n\nProsecutors call it a ploy to portray the boyish-looking Shkreli as “a Horatio Alger-like figure who, through hard work and intelligence, is in a position to do great things if only the jury would ignore the evidence and base its verdict on sympathy.” The real Shkreli was a con man often undone by his own mouth, they say.\n\nThe government has cited claims by one of Shkreli’s former employees that Shkreli harassed his family in a dispute over shares of stock.\n\n“I hope to see you and your four children homeless and will do whatever I can to assure this,” Shkreli wrote the employee’s wife, according to court filings.\n\nProsecutors also used his boasts about some of his purchases of eccentric collectibles to undermine efforts to reduce his bail from $5 million to $2 million. If he needed to raise cash to pay legal fees and back taxes, they argued, why not sell the one-of-a-kind Wu-Tang Clan album that he brought for $2 million or his Nazi-era Engima code-breaking machine?\n\nAlso cited were his offers to pay a $100,000 bounty for finding the killer of a Democratic National Committee staffer and $40,000 in tuition for a Princeton student who solved a math problem he posed during a guest lecture at the school earlier this year.\n\nShkreli “is not the demon he’s been made out to be,” the student, Yuan Wang, told the AP.\n\nStill, he added, “I haven’t received the money yet.”	2017-06-26 11:39:55.999205+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	6	744	['The Washington Times Http', 'Tom Hays']

(AP) - Clint Dempsey likened his goal against the Timbers to a slam dunk.\nDempsey scored in stoppage time and the Seattle Sounders pulled into a hard-fought 2-2 draw with rival Portland in a Cascadia Cup match on Sunday night.\nIt gave Dempsey nine goals against the Timbers, making him the top scorer in MLS play between the teams.\nThe two teams and the Vancouver Whitecaps play in the unique three-way Cascadia Cup, decided each season on points.\n“Any goal is a great goal.”The Sounders won the season’s first league match between the teams 1-0 on May 27, then won a fourth-round U.S. Open Cup match 2-1 earlier this month.	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) - Clint Dempsey likened his goal against the Timbers to a slam dunk.\n\nDempsey scored in stoppage time and the Seattle Sounders pulled into a hard-fought 2-2 draw with rival Portland in a Cascadia Cup match on Sunday night.\n\nFanendo Adi scored his 50th career goal for Portland and Dairon Asprilla added another at the end of the first half to give the Timbers a 2-1 advantage until Dempsey’s late equalizer - a perfectly placed header in the final to stun the home crowd at Providence Park.\n\nIt gave Dempsey nine goals against the Timbers, making him the top scorer in MLS play between the teams. It is also the most goals the veteran midfielder has against any league team.\n\n“It definitely feels good. I guess it’s what it must feel like to slam dunk in a game, because you’re just going up for it and giving it everything you have on it and putting on frame,” said Dempsey, who came in as a sub in the second half.\n\nThe Sounders, who took a 1-0 lead in the 27th minute when Joevin Jones scored on his own rebound, played a man down after Brad Evans was sent off with a red card in the final minutes of the first half. Seattle is winless in three straight games.\n\nHeat in Portland moved the game to the evening, but temperatures were still in the 90s at the start of the game. The game was stopped for a hydration break in the first half.\n\nThe two teams and the Vancouver Whitecaps play in the unique three-way Cascadia Cup, decided each season on points. The rivalry dates to 1975 when the teams were with the old North American Soccer League, but fans of the three teams christened the Cascadia Cup in 2004. Vancouver is the defending cup champion.\n\n“Feels like a loss. Very disappointing,” Timbers coach Celeb Porter said. “Didn’t think we managed the second half well. This has now become a pattern. Again, we’re in a winning position and don’t show a strong enough mentality, a strong enough urgency. When I look at how we played after we gave up the goal, that’s the way we should play every game, for 90 minutes.”\n\nThe Timbers tied it at 1 in the 44th minute on Adi’s penalty kick. Evans got the red card for bringing down Darlington Nagbe in the box and was sent off.\n\nAdi is the first Timbers player to reach 50 goals over all eras of the team. He upped his total this season to nine goals.\n\nAdi has eight goals in 10 career games against the Sounders, making him Portland’s all-time leading scorer against Seattle.\n\nPortland, which had dropped its previous two matches, went ahead 2-1 in first-half stoppage time on Asprilla’s header off a corner kick, which he celebrated with backflips.\n\nDempsey came in as a sub in the 56th minute.

Rand Paul, R-Ky., said he is opposing the Senate bill because it “is not anywhere close to repeal” of the Affordable Care Act.\nBut I think they’re going to get there,” Trump said of Republican Senate leaders.	WASHINGTON (AP) - Senate Republicans skeptical about a GOP health overhaul bill are expressing some doubt about holding a vote this week as they await a key analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. President Donald Trump, making a final push to fulfill a key campaign promise, insists Republicans are not “that far off” and signaled last-minute changes are coming to win votes.\n\n“We have a very good plan,” Trump said in an interview aired Sunday. Referring to Republican senators opposed to the bill, he added: “They want to get some points, I think they’ll get some points.”\n\nSo far, five Republican senators are expressing opposition to the Senate GOP plan that would scuttle much of former President Barack Obama’s health law. That’s more than enough to torpedo the measure developed in private by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and deliver a bitter defeat for the president.\n\nThe holdouts are expressing willingness to negotiate, but many of them are pushing revisions that could risk alienating moderate Republicans in the process.\n\nSen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said seven to eight additional senators including herself were troubled by provisions in the Senate bill that she believes could cut Medicaid for the poor even more than the House version. Collins, who also opposes proposed cuts to Planned Parenthood, said she was awaiting the CBO analysis before taking a final position. But she said it will be “extremely difficult” for the White House to be able to find a narrow path to attract both conservatives and moderates.\n\nThe CBO cost estimate, including an analysis on the number of people likely to be covered, is expected to be released as early as Monday.\n\n“It’s hard for me to see the bill passing this week,” Collins said.\n\nSen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., one of the five senators opposing the bill, said he also wants to review the CBO score.\n\n“I would like to delay,” he said. “These bills aren’t going to fix the problem. They’re not addressing the root cause,” he said, referring to rising health care costs. “They’re doing the same old Washington thing, throwing more money at the problem.”\n\nIn the broadcast interview, Trump did not indicate what types of changes to the Senate bill may be in store, but affirmed that he had described a House-passed bill as “mean.”\n\n“I want to see a bill with heart,” he said, confirming a switch from his laudatory statements about the House bill at a Rose Garden ceremony with House GOP leaders last month. “Health care’s a very complicated subject from the standpoint that you move it this way, and this group doesn’t like it.”\n\n“And honestly, nobody can be totally happy,” Trump said.\n\nMcConnell has said he’s willing to make changes to win support, and in the week ahead, plenty of backroom bargaining is expected. He is seeking to push a final package through the Senate before the July 4 recess.\n\nAddressing reporters Sunday, the Senate’s No. 2 Republican said passing a health care bill won’t get any easier if Republican leaders delay a Senate vote on the GOP health care plan. Sen. John Cornyn of Texas said there is “a sense of urgency” to push forward but acknowledged the outcome is “going to be close.”\n\nHe told reporters at a private gathering hosted by the libertarian Koch brothers in Colorado that Trump will be “important” in securing the final votes.\n\n“We’re trying to hold him back a little bit,” Cornyn said with a smile.\n\nThe Senate bill resembles legislation the House approved last month. A CBO analysis of the House measure predicts an additional 23 million people over the next decade would have no health care coverage, and recent polling shows only around 1 in 4 Americans views the House bill favorably.\n\nThe legislation would phase out extra federal money that more than 30 states receive for expanding Medicaid to additional low-income earners. It would also slap annual spending caps on the overall Medicaid program, which since its inception in 1965 has provided states with unlimited money to cover eligible costs.\n\nConservative Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said he is opposing the Senate bill because it “is not anywhere close to repeal” of the Affordable Care Act. He says the bill offers too many tax credits that help poorer people to buy insurance.\n\n“If we get to impasse, if we go to a bill that is more repeal and less big government programs, yes, I’ll consider partial repeal,” he said. “I’m not voting for something that looks just like Obamacare.”\n\nTrump said he thinks Republicans in the Senate are doing the best they can to push through the bill.\n\n“I don’t think they’re that far off. Famous last words, right? But I think they’re going to get there,” Trump said of Republican Senate leaders. “We don’t have too much of a choice, because the alternative is the dead carcass of Obamacare.”\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said Democrats have been clear they will cooperate with Republicans if they agree to drop a repeal of the Affordable Care Act and instead work to improve it. Still, Schumer acknowledged it was too close to call as to whether Republicans could muster enough support on their own to pass the bill.\n\nHe said they had “at best, a 50-50 chance.”\n\nTrump was interviewed by “Fox & Friends,” while Collins, Schumer and Paul appeared on ABC’s “This Week.” Johnson spoke on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Steve Peoples in Colorado Springs, Colorado, contributed to this report.	2017-06-26 11:40:00.095011+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	6	747	['The Washington Times Http', 'Richard Lardner']

OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) - A year ago, uncertainty surrounded Russell Westbrook.\n\nKevin Durant stunned the league by leaving Oklahoma City for rival Golden State in free agency. The four-time scoring champion and former MVP had been the central piece in making the Thunder one of the league’s elite teams since the franchise’s move to Oklahoma City in 2008.\n\nWestbrook had played his entire NBA career alongside Durant, so questions about how Westbrook would respond immediately cropped up.\n\nHe defiantly answered them with memorable performances.\n\nWestbrook became the first player since Oscar Robertson in 1961-62 to average a triple-double for a season and won his second scoring title. He broke Robertson’s single-season record with 42 triple-doubles and led the Thunder to the playoffs. Now, he will join Houston’s James Harden and San Antonio’s Kawhi Leonard as finalists for the league’s MVP award. The winner will be announced Monday at the inaugural NBA Awards show.\n\nWestbrook gained satisfaction from the team’s success, which largely was fueled by his personal dominance.\n\n“With everything happening last summer, people counted us out,” he said the day after Oklahoma City’s season ended. “They weren’t sure how many games we were going to win or how far we were going to go or whatever, but I think the group of guys, we never let that sink in our building. We stuck together, and that’s the thing I’m most proud about.”\n\nWestbrook wasn’t just stat stuffing, either. The Thunder went 33-9 when he had a triple-double and 14-26 when he didn’t. He seemingly gained energy as the season progressed and was statistically better after the All-Star break than before. As for those late-game situations, he led the league with 10 points per game in the fourth quarter and was one of the most dynamic closers in the league.\n\nWestbrook topped Robertson’s single-season, triple-double record on April 9 in Denver. His 36-foot game-winning dagger put the final touch on a 50-point, 16-rebound, 10-assist performance that eliminated the Nuggets from playoff contention.\n\nRobertson himself showed up to the Thunder’s regular-season finale and endorsed Westbrook for the MVP award.\n\n“What he has done has been historic in nature,” Robertson told the crowd that night. “He’s played with passion and pride and ability. It’s just outstanding what he has done and the way he did it.”\n\nDurant might be the least surprised player in the league. Westbrook was dominant while Durant was out with a foot injury during the 2014-15 season and claimed his first scoring title, but it wasn’t clear if he could do it all - score, dominate the boards, consistently feed his teammates and come through in big moments - for an entire season.\n\nTurns out, he could.\n\nIn the second game of the season, he had 51 points, 13 rebounds and 10 assists in a victory over Phoenix, the first 50-point triple-double since Kareem Abdul-Jabbar did it in 1975. On March 27, he had 13 points in a 3-minute barrage to rally the Thunder past Dallas. Two days later in Orlando, he scored 57 points and posted the most points ever in a triple-double. He hit a deep 3-pointer to force overtime, and eventually helped the Thunder win. In one of his most memorable games, he scored 47 points in a loss to Durant’s Warriors.\n\nHarden and Leonard also had MVP-caliber seasons:\n\n_____\n\nJAMES HARDEN, HOUSTON\n\nAs stunning as Westbrook’s triple-double binge was this season, Harden’s was impressive, too.\n\nHe posted 22 triple-doubles and helped the Rockets finish with the league’s third-best record. Harden, known primarily as a scorer throughout his career, shifted from shooting guard to point guard and was nearly unstoppable in coach Mike D’Antoni’s fast-paced offense.\n\nHarden led the league with 11.2 assists per game and finished second with 29.1 points per contest. In perhaps his best performance, he had 53 points, 16 rebounds and 17 assists against the New York Knicks on New Year’s Eve.\n\n___\n\nKAWHI LEONARD, SAN ANTONIO\n\nLeonard is the two-time reigning Defensive Player of the Year, and he’s up for the honor again.\n\nYet, it was the 6-foot-7 forward’s offensive improvement that put him in the mix for the MVP award. He averaged 25.5 points this season after averaging 21.2 the previous year.\n\nLeonard helped the Spurs finish with the league’s second-best record. He seemed to play as the stage got bigger.\n\nHe opened the season with a career-high 35 points in a blowout win over the Warriors. Leonard upped that career high with 41 points in a win over Cleveland on Jan. 21, and he dropped 39 points in a victory over Houston on March 6.\n\n___\n\nFollow Cliff Brunt on Twitter: www.twitter.com/CliffBruntAP .	2017-06-26 11:40:01.339297+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	6	748	['The Washington Times Http', 'Cliff Brunt']

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email\n\nPlaid Cymru’s new Westminster leader argues Wales need not worry that no party has an overall majority in the Commons but should grasp the chance to win the best deal for this nation.\n\nLiz Saville Roberts is inspired by how her party was able to win compensation for quarry workers and miners suffering with pneumoconiosis in 1978’s hung parliament.\n\nThe Plaid group increased from three MPs to four in this month’s election and Ms Roberts is confident there will be opportunities to push for the UK to stay in the single market despite Brexit and to roll back austerity policies.\n\nThe Dwyfor Meirionnydd MP said: “We will create the kind of Wales we want beyond Brexit.”\n\nMs Roberts, who was raised in London before coming to Aberystwyth to study and who has lived in Morfa Nefyn since 1993, claimed that people who say a hung parliament is weak or dangerous are doing so to “cynically engineer” another election.\n\nHere are six reasons why she argues Wales should welcome a hung parliament:\n\n1. Plaid negotiated deals for Wales during a hung parliament in the 1970s and will aim to do so again.\n\n(Photo: Daily Post Wales)\n\n“Plaid Cymru has a legacy of negotiating major concessions for Wales in previous balanced Parliaments. This includes securing hundreds of millions of pounds worth of compensation through the Workers Compensation Act 1979 for miners and quarry workers; millions of pounds worth of investment in Welsh transport, culture and economic development; and increasing Wales’s representation on the EU’s Committee of the Regions.”\n\n2. This is an opportunity to fight to keep Wales in the single market.\n\n“Brexit means that this Parliamentary session will be the most significant yet for the future of every nation in the UK. Whilst the Westminster parties continue to fight amongst themselves on what their position should be, Plaid Cymru has been consistent from the start – we must protect our economic links with the continent and the rest of the world through maintaining our membership of the Single Market and Customs Union.”\n\n3. Hung parliaments are not considered frightening in much of the world.\n\n“Some people consider a hung parliament to be a threat to the Westminster bi-polar norm, but for Plaid Cymru and for Wales, there is a wealth of opportunities in a balanced state of power-play.\n\n“We are faced with a situation where no party has a clear majority... The balanced Parliament places a duty on all of us – no matter what party – to deliver changes that reflect the outcome of the election.\n\n“While this is a rare opportunity in the UK, unwelcome and unwanted by the two main parties, it is commonplace in many successful democracies across the world. It obliges parties to work together to deliver for all political opinions from all parts of the UK.\n\n“Surely this is democracy at its best?”\n\n4. This is a chance to put Wales’ economy on Westminster’s radar.\n\n“After decades of underinvestment and unambitious Wales Bills handing our country the crumbs off of the English table, this is our opportunity to force Westminster to sit up and listen to us. While London is the richest region in Europe, Wales suffers as the poorest of the UK countries, with 22% of people living in absolute poverty.”\n\n5. The hung parliament has given Plaid’s four MPs new influence.\n\n(Photo: Marian Delyth)\n\n“The arithmetic of this Parliament means Plaid Cymru’s influence is greater than ever. Plaid Cymru MPs will use this unique position for one purpose – to forward Wales’s national interest. This means securing concessions from the debilitated Tory-DUP alliance, to get the money to keep the cogs of our economy turning; the powers so that we can take decisions into our own hands; and the respect to ensure that we can hold our head high as a nation and make sure Wales can succeed throughout Brexit and beyond.”\n\n6. This is the moment for anti-austerity alliances.\n\n“The democratic reality is that the majority of the electorate voted for parties committed to remedying austerity, creating well-paid secure jobs and supporting measures that protect our environment. We can now work with each other to create real change and carve out a better way, through determined opposition to the Tories turbo-charged by the DUP.\n\n“We will use this alternative politics in the balanced Parliament to score compromises which work for Wales, and to make Wales matter through Brexit and beyond.”	2017-06-26 11:40:03.015111+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	50	749	['David Williamson', 'Photo', 'Daily Post Wales', 'Marian Delyth']

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email\n\nLabour played big part in demise of coal industry\n\nThe Labour Party was a far bigger contributor to the demise of the coal industry in Wales than Margaret Thatcher.\n\nBy 1913 there were more than 250,000 men employed in the coal industry in Wales. The Royal Navy used Welsh coal to fuel its ships, because Welsh steam coal was particularly suited to use by warships. Bilbao’s industrial powerhouse was powered by Welsh coal. It was all going to come crashing down with disastrous effects because of decisions made by a few people in Westminster.\n\nThe Liberal Winston Churchill assumed the reins of the Admiralty in 1911, and pursued a long-term policy for the Royal Navy to convert the fleet to depend exclusively on oil to power its ships, which was to have severe consequences on the coal industry in Wales.\n\nDuring the premiership of Labour’s Harold Wilson in the 1960s, the Energy Minister Anthony Wedgwood Benn (before he became Tony Benn and a socialist) closed hundreds of coal mines in Wales, putting 100,000 miners out of work to pursue a policy of generating nuclear power.\n\nIt is ironical that it was Labour’s nuclear power plants that enabled the Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to crush the miners’ strike in 1985, and close the remaining collieries in Wales with no resistance from Neil Kinnock’s impotent Labour Party.\n\nThese sad episodes are a glowing indictment that the Westminster system and the Labour Party does not work for Wales.\n\nIlltyd ap Dafydd\n\nNantyffyllon, Maesteg\n\nWhy wasn’t Christ’s name bleeped out?\n\nWHY is it that the name of Jesus Christ is very often used by some people as a common swear word?\n\nI refer to recent BBC news footage regarding the brave firefighters responding to the Grenfell Tower fire where many tragically lost their lives.\n\nAs the firemen approached the blazing building they were obviously short of expletives.\n\nThere were a few swear words expressed that were soon “bleeped” out.\n\nThe name of Jesus Christ though, which was used as a reaction to this tragedy, was left on the screen.\n\nThis might not seem important to some but one can only imagine the backlash if Mohammed or Allah was used in the same derogatory manner.\n\nAlan Milsom\n\nCaerphilly\n\nUlster’s gain will be Wales’ loss\n\nThe Democratic Unionist Party broke off talks with Theresa May this week as it told her to spend £2bn in Northern Ireland if she wants the party to prop up her minority Conservative Government.\n\nThe DUP demanded the cash, which works out as £1,100 per person in the province, as talks veered dangerously close to breaking down altogether.\n\nWales is firmly back of the queue: the Severn tolls weren’t even mentioned in the Queen’s speech.\n\nLondon’s focus has been on stopping Scotland leaving the Union and Northern Ireland getting this\n\nextra money and having a Brexit\n\ndeal to keep the north-south border open.\n\nThis means Welsh ports will be overlooked, as all transport would go through Belfast and on to Liverpool. Wales could be looking at further job losses in these ports, if Wales has a hard Brexit.\n\nAndrew Nutt\n\nBargoed	2017-06-26 11:40:04.335875+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	50	750

Get rugby updates directly to your inbox + Subscribe Thank you for subscribing! Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email\n\nJazz Richards is a player coming into his own.\n\nTwo years ago he was being loaned out by Swansea City, now he wants to be a permanent fixture in the Wales first team. He wants promotion with Cardiff City.\n\nIt hasn't been a straightforward transition, however. Nothing has come quickly nor easily for Richards; injuries hampered his progress, but the 26-year-old is stepping out of the shadows to fly the Welsh flag, both for Cardiff and his country.\n\nEven 12 months ago Richards was forced to negotiate a major obstacle upon moving to the Welsh capital club. His Swansea past couldn't be ignored and a storm brewed around the talented full-back when impassioned Bluebirds fans implored him to do the 'Ayatollah' in an August clash with Birmingham City. Sceptical supporters saw it as an initiation for the Swansea lad.\n\n(Photo: Huw Evans Picture Agency)\n\nAnd yet, a year down the line, Richards prepares for his second season at Cardiff City Stadium with the matter virtually forgotten, consigned to the history books because of the full back's consistency last term.\n\n"The whole thing about moving from Swansea to Cardiff was easy for me," insists Richards when the inevitable subject is broached.\n\n"I was never one of those players who was disrespectful towards Cardiff, or supported Swansea over Cardiff. I just played the game and got on with it, it was easy for me to deal with.\n\n"The response from Cardiff fans was great, all positive comments. I think being involved with Wales helped. There was obviously the gesture of doing the Ayatollah but that all blew over fairly quick and they know I'm here to play for them. They were very positive with me after that."\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nInvolvement with Wales' Euro 2016 squad definitely helped.\n\nAlthough Richards featured just once (against Slovakia) in the dream run to Euro semi-finals, he and Emyr Huws were brought to Cardiff as beacons of Welsh hope, at a club which was increasingly losing any flavour of the 'homegrown'.\n\nOf course, the 'Wales Way' didn't work for the Bluebirds and Trollope. But it is testament to Richards' determination and durability that he overcame an early managerial change — plus the Swansea connection and a major training injury — to thrive for Cardiff in the second half of the season. Some of Trollope's other signings: Huws, Rickie Lambert, Lex Immers and Frederic Gounongbe, failed to adapt.\n\n(Photo: Huw Evans Picture Agency)\n\nThe reason? Richards is in his prime and was desperate to prove his doubters wrong. He knew he would make a success of his Cardiff move.\n\n"Neil wanted me to come back as fit as possible to play in the team," he says.\n\n"I had to go through eight weeks of injury and fight my way back.\n\n"The end of last season was very positive. I'd say it was a good season, but I'm hoping for better."\n\nRichards strung together some imperious displays at right-back from January onwards, making the most of Lee Peltier's injury to earn a first team berth. With Joe Bennett marauding down the left, the pair brought a new dimension to the Bluebirds' attacking play under Warnock.\n\nIt was those performances, that remarkable return from injury, which earned a precious call-up to Chris Coleman's first team.\n\nThe Wales boss doesn't often make changes — why would he? — but Neil Taylor's suspension forced his hand.\n\nWales needed a reliable option at wing-back to step into a hostile Belgrade atmosphere. They needed someone to help eke out a result away from home to keep their World Cup qualification hopes alive. Enter Richards.\n\n"I thrive off (hostile atmospheres), where the fans are loud and on your back, it gets me more hyped for the game," he says of that 1-1 draw with Serbia.\n\n"We just got on with our jobs."\n\nMight there be a future spot for Richards in the Wales first team? If that performance is anything to go by, certainly.\n\nNot only did he appear at home on the pitch, he's been a part of the Welsh furniture for a number of years. This one was an easier transition.\n\n"I'm hoping to play again and get more games going forward," adds the full back.\n\n"I've been in the squad for a few years now and I know those guys are really humble and down to earth. That's what makes it really easy. You feel part of the group, like they're your mates. For example, Gareth Bale is a really nice lad.\n\n"It's normal when you're there in that environment, but it seems abnormal looking at it from the outside."\n\n(Photo: Nick Potts/PA Wire)\n\nAs for the World Cup, could Richards find himself starting for Wales at Russia 2018?\n\n"We can definitely do it. We've got more than a good team and we know our strengths. We put that into practice and we put that into reality out on the pitch. I think you've seen over the past few years how good we are as a team."\n\nBack at Cardiff, the arrival of Callum Paterson from Hearts ensures Richards will continue to face obstacles. The Bluebirds are enormously well stocked at full back with Bennett, Peltier and Matt Connolly also available in Richards' two favoured positions.\n\n"The club rate (Paterson) highly and I know he's rated highly in Scotland as well," adds Richards.\n\n"But it's good to strengthen the squad, it's good to have the competition for places."\n\n(Photo: Huw Evans Picture Agency)\n\nRichards now has a rigorous pre-season schedule to look forward to. Warnock expects his troops to push the boundaries of expectation and challenge for promotion next season.\n\n"He's a brilliant manager," Richards says of the Yorkshireman.\n\n"He wears his heart on his sleeve and he will tell you how it is. If he likes you, he likes you; if he doesn't, he doesn't.\n\n"But I think it's his motivational skills and how much belief he has in the players that gets the boys up for the games. He and the coaching staff have done very well since coming in. We want to get off to a good start."\n\nJazz Richards was speaking at the McDonald's & FAW Community Football Day in Swansea, celebrating 15 years of McDonald’s partnering with the four UK home nations & supporting grassroots football.

This means the books that went on general sale twenty years ago are now very valuable.\n\nRare bookseller Peter Harrington estimates that first edition hardbacks could be worth up to £50,000 - this is because not many hardback versions were originally printed, making them extremely rare to come across.\n\nHowever paperbacks are also worth a pretty penny and could earn you a four-figure sum, one is currently on sale for £4,800 on literary website stmarysbooks.com\n\nHow can I tell if my book is valuable?\n\nAt the bottom of the title page the publisher must be listed as Bloomsbury\n\n\n\nThe date listed in the copyright information should say 1997\n\n\n\nThe print line on the copyright page must read “10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1”\n\n\n\n\n\nThe book should say it was printed in the UK, not any other country\n\nOn page 53 “1 wand” must be written twice in the list\n\nBut JK Rowling's the Philosopher's Stone isn't the only valuable book.

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email\n\nPlaid Cymru’s new Westminster leader argues Wales need not worry that no party has an overall majority in the Commons but should grasp the chance to win the best deal for this nation.\n\nLiz Saville Roberts is inspired by how her party was able to win compensation for quarry workers and miners suffering with pneumoconiosis in 1978’s hung parliament.\n\nThe Plaid group increased from three MPs to four in this month’s election and Ms Roberts is confident there will be opportunities to push for the UK to stay in the single market despite Brexit and to roll back austerity policies.\n\nThe Dwyfor Meirionnydd MP said: “We will create the kind of Wales we want beyond Brexit.”\n\nMs Roberts, who was raised in London before coming to Aberystwyth to study and who has lived in Morfa Nefyn since 1993, claimed that people who say a hung parliament is weak or dangerous are doing so to “cynically engineer” another election.\n\nHere are six reasons why she argues Wales should welcome a hung parliament:\n\n1. Plaid negotiated deals for Wales during a hung parliament in the 1970s and will aim to do so again.\n\n(Photo: Daily Post Wales)\n\n“Plaid Cymru has a legacy of negotiating major concessions for Wales in previous balanced Parliaments. This includes securing hundreds of millions of pounds worth of compensation through the Workers Compensation Act 1979 for miners and quarry workers; millions of pounds worth of investment in Welsh transport, culture and economic development; and increasing Wales’s representation on the EU’s Committee of the Regions.”\n\n2. This is an opportunity to fight to keep Wales in the single market.\n\n“Brexit means that this Parliamentary session will be the most significant yet for the future of every nation in the UK. Whilst the Westminster parties continue to fight amongst themselves on what their position should be, Plaid Cymru has been consistent from the start – we must protect our economic links with the continent and the rest of the world through maintaining our membership of the Single Market and Customs Union.”\n\n3. Hung parliaments are not considered frightening in much of the world.\n\n“Some people consider a hung parliament to be a threat to the Westminster bi-polar norm, but for Plaid Cymru and for Wales, there is a wealth of opportunities in a balanced state of power-play.\n\n“We are faced with a situation where no party has a clear majority... The balanced Parliament places a duty on all of us – no matter what party – to deliver changes that reflect the outcome of the election.\n\n“While this is a rare opportunity in the UK, unwelcome and unwanted by the two main parties, it is commonplace in many successful democracies across the world. It obliges parties to work together to deliver for all political opinions from all parts of the UK.\n\n“Surely this is democracy at its best?”\n\n4. This is a chance to put Wales’ economy on Westminster’s radar.\n\n“After decades of underinvestment and unambitious Wales Bills handing our country the crumbs off of the English table, this is our opportunity to force Westminster to sit up and listen to us. While London is the richest region in Europe, Wales suffers as the poorest of the UK countries, with 22% of people living in absolute poverty.”\n\n5. The hung parliament has given Plaid’s four MPs new influence.\n\n(Photo: Marian Delyth)\n\n“The arithmetic of this Parliament means Plaid Cymru’s influence is greater than ever. Plaid Cymru MPs will use this unique position for one purpose – to forward Wales’s national interest. This means securing concessions from the debilitated Tory-DUP alliance, to get the money to keep the cogs of our economy turning; the powers so that we can take decisions into our own hands; and the respect to ensure that we can hold our head high as a nation and make sure Wales can succeed throughout Brexit and beyond.”\n\n6. This is the moment for anti-austerity alliances.\n\n“The democratic reality is that the majority of the electorate voted for parties committed to remedying austerity, creating well-paid secure jobs and supporting measures that protect our environment. We can now work with each other to create real change and carve out a better way, through determined opposition to the Tories turbo-charged by the DUP.\n\n“We will use this alternative politics in the balanced Parliament to score compromises which work for Wales, and to make Wales matter through Brexit and beyond.”	2017-06-26 11:40:21.476655+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	50	763	['David Williamson', 'Photo', 'Daily Post Wales', 'Marian Delyth']

The fact that this has happened despite the potential uncertainty from the snap general election, is another positive sign for underlying confidence across the country.”\n\nGetting the right person for the job can be tough\n\n(Photo: iStock/Getty)\n\nThere were falls in share of Welsh firms naming political uncertainty (down from 8% to 6%) and weaker UK demand (down from 20% to 11%) on the six months ago.\n\nHowever, the proportion of businesses in Wales that said they had experienced difficulty in recruiting skilled labour in the last six months went up to 32% compared with 27% per cent in January.\n\nThe net balance of firms expecting average pay to rise in the next six months also dropped slightly to 14% from 16% in shift which suggests caution when it comes to hiring and pay.\n\nBusinesses are taking uncertainty in their stride\n\nMr Griffiths said: “Despite hurdles in recruiting skilled labour, Welsh businesses also anticipate sales, profits, and staffing levels to rise. The outlook for the external environment remains mixed, with details of Britain’s exit from the EU still to come but businesses have been working within those parameters for a while now.\n\n“For the moment, businesses in Wales are taking this in their stride until there is a clearer sense of what it will mean for them in the short and medium term.”\n\nThere is excitement about exports to North America\n\nWelsh companies were more positive about export prospects.

What John Rostron and the boys have been doing has been brilliant for the Welsh music scene, and it is great they are looking nationally for a wider audience.\n\n“It is great for Swansea to be able to step-up, and I hope people turn out and show what a welcome we can put on, and hopefully encourage organisers to come back bigger and better the following year.”\n\nThe hero of the London Marathon ran the Swansea Half with the man he helped over the line - and they want to do it again next year\n\nJohn Rostron added: “For a while I’d deliberated over Swn’s future, but we had an over whelming response to last year’s event and a huge demand from the music scene in Wales that this festival is needed.\n\n“Turning ten gave us an opportunity to rebuild the festival in a new way.\n\n“Swn has been putting on shows outside of the main weekend for a while, so it will now bring a series of concerts together across a whole month.\n\n“This is just the beginning of the fun, there are plenty more surprises to come yet, so watch this space.”\n\nSwn Festival run from September 22 to October 21.\n\nDetails are available at swnfest.com	2017-06-26 11:40:15.004536+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	50	758	['Nino Williams']

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email\n\nSteve Hansen has labelled Warren Gatland as “desperate” and “predictable” for claiming the All Blacks targeted Lions scrum-half Conor Murray.\n\nGaltland says he’s concerned over the way Kiwi players dived at Murray’s legs as the scrum-half was box kicking during Saturday’s first Test in Auckland.\n\nHe says it is dangerous and could cause a serious injury and has called on officials to protect the Irishman in this weekend’s rematch at Wellington’s Westpac Stadium.\n\nNow New Zealand coach Hansen has hit back, in the wake of his team’s 30-15 victory, calling Gatland’s comments “really, really disappointing”.\n\nHe says he takes serious issue with the implication that his players are going out to injure an opponent.\n\n“It’s predictable comments from Gatland, isn’t it?” he told Radio Sport New Zealand.\n\n“Two weeks ago, we cheated in the scrums, last week it was blocking and now he’s saying this.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\n“It’s really, really disappointing to hear it because what he’s implying is we are intentionally going out to injure somebody and that’s not the case. We’ve never been like that.\n\n“As a New Zealander, I would expect him to know the New Zealand psyche. It’s not about intentionally trying to hurt anybody, it’s about playing hard and fair.\n\n“If you look at the Test match, both sets of players earned the respect of each other in a physical contest. At the time, no-one was complaining about anything that was off-key and the fans that watched it loved it.\n\n“So it’s just really, really disappointing to hear him say that, to take away the gloss of not only the Test match but from his own team’s performance as well.\n\n“I guess he might be a bit desperate or something. I’m not sure, I don’t know why he would be saying it.\n\n“He is implying we are trying to hurt the guy. Rugby is about playing within the laws and in this case we are trying to charge the kick down and or tackle him.\n\n“Both those things are legal, they are allowed, that’s what the game is built around.\n\n“Just because he is one of their key players that doesn’t mean to say he has the right to go around the park without being charged down or tackled.\n\n“It’s just disappointing that after such a great Test match, Gatland is coming out and saying something like that. I don’t know where he’s coming from.”\n\nThe Lions coach has said he will be seeking clarification from second Test referee Jerome Garces on the issue and asking for the officials to protect Murray.\n\nResponding to this, Hansen said: “I wouldn’t expect it to be a topic of conversation with officials.\n\n“There is a guy who is watching for foul play all the time and if he felt it was foul play he would have indicated to the referee.\n\n“It wasn’t and it never was and never will be as long as I am involved with the All Blacks. It’s just not the way we do things in our world.\n\n“We are a team that wants to play hard, but fair and we challenge teams to do the same to us and then we’ll see who has got the best skill sets and the best ability to take the opportunities that are given.”\n\nHansen also gave a reaction to Gatland saying the All Blacks didn’t play champagne rugby in winning the series opener at Eden Park.\n\n“I guess it’s another predictable comment coming from Gats,” he said.\n\n“He’s looking to take the heat off his own team and I guess that’s what you need to do as a coach, I suppose.”\n\nReflecting on his own side’s performance, Hansen said: “I thought we came to the Test with a great attitude.\n\n“We knew clearly what we wanted to do and how we wanted to achieve it. Then it was about implementing it and the boys did it really well.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\n“Both teams played really well, but we were fortunate to seize our opportunities and that was probably the difference between winning and losing.”\n\nThe foundations for the All Blacks’ victory were laid up front, much to the satisfaction of their coach.\n\n“We know we have got a quality forward pack,” said Hansen.\n\n“You don’t be the number one side in the world for the time we have been without having a forward pack that can do their core roles really well.\n\n“We see them doing other stuff, like catch and pass and run with the ball, but they do their core roles really well to give you an opportunity to be able to play the game.”\n\nHansen was particularly fulsome in his praise for skipper Keiran Read, who excelled despite playing his first game in seven weeks due to a broken thumb.\n\n“Keiran hasn’t had any rugby and his performance was phenomenal,” he said.\n\n“It is what we have come to expect from All Blacks captains, isn’t it?\n\n“They have got the ability not only to lead people around the park through their voice but also through their individual performances.\n\n(Photo: Inpho)\n\n“You expect them to be mentally strong and have fortitude and resilience. We have seen it in past captains. Richie McCaw has done it before and now Keiran is stepping up to the plate and doing it as well. It inspires other people.”\n\nOn the fitness front, full-back Ben Smith is going through concussion protocols having failed a HIA test after taking a bang to the head during Saturday’s game, while centre Ryan Crotty has a hamstring strain. Flanker Jerome Kaino has passed a HIA examination and has no other symptoms.\n\nIt was Kaino who made a low diving lunge at Murray after ten minutes, catching the Lions scrum-half on his standing leg after he had kicked the ball.\n\nMurray was also left holding his wrist after a collision with Brodie Retallick just before the break, while Sam Whitelock could be seen to push the Munsterman to the ground as the All Blacks looked to put pressure on his box-kicking game.	2017-06-26 11:40:17.725996+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	50	760	['Simon Thomas', 'Photo', 'Inpho']

The public, however, are not so gullible.\n\nThe result of the survey as quoted above shows a 61% in favour of the name change, but a different picture emerges when the finer points are investigated. The total number involved in this exercise was approximately 3,000; the population of Wales is about 3,000,000 – this means that just a 1,000th of the population were included and this is taken for granted by AMs.\n\nPractically every survey by the Assembly and Welsh-language societies is skewed in some way and always lacks detail.\n\nThis is not democracy but perhaps this is the way it is interpreted by AMs and fellow travellers.\n\nK Clements\n\nSwansea\n\nFailing to train youth for the world of work\n\nIn the past the Labour Party represented the aspirations of most working-class families, but I don’t think they do now.\n\nWhen I was a young man they and the unions fought to get blue-collar workers into company pension schemes and to assist workers to buy their own homes.\n\nWhen I look back, it was the Conservatives that changed the company pensions to include workers and it was the Conservatives who gave us tax relief on mortgages. Who took these away? The Labour Government.\n\nWhen I was a young man there was no such thing as zero-hours contracts, virtually all apprentices were British-born and thousands of tradesmen worked all over the world. Now I read that we would have to bring in foreign tradesmen to renovate our Parliament buildings because we are so short of tradesmen of our own.\n\nIn the 1960s there was a lot of articles about the brain drain, doctors, nurses, engineers and scientists emigrating because they thought opportunities were better elsewhere. Now we have to import these people because we don’t train enough of our own.\n\nWhat happened to “education, education, education”? Instead of rising in the world education tables, we are falling further and further behind. In the 1950s and ’60s Britain had one of the highest ratings in the world and lots of countries copied our system. We are failing our children and young people because of ideology and a lack of motivation to acquire skills suitable for the commercial world. Children have to accept discipline in schools because an employer will insist on it as soon as they start work.\n\nWe need to sort out our universities to provide courses and qualifications that are needed for viable careers. They should cut down the number of places on “Mickey Mouse “ courses – youngsters need to be able to earn a decent living when they leave university.\n\nThere are quite a large number of youngsters who have found their degree is no help in finding a job in a worthwhile career. Education for education’s sake is a joke.\n\nOne last thing – the arrogance of MPs and political commentators is stunning. How can they say that the vote in the referendum was due to people being misled?\n\nWell I have to say that all the information that was published came from these very people. The worst invention of the 20th century was the professional politician.\n\nBill Symons\n\nCardiff\n\nLabour, not Thatcher, killed coal industry\n\nThe Labour Party was a far bigger contributor to the demise of the coal industry in Wales than Margaret Thatcher!\n\nBy 1913 there were over 250,000 men employed in the coal industry in Wales. The Royal Navy used Welsh coal to fuel its ships, because Welsh steam coal was particularly suited to use by warships. Bilbao’s industrial powerhouse was powered by Welsh coal. It was all going to come crashing down with disastrous effects because of decisions made by a few people in Westminster.\n\nThe Liberal Winston Churchill assumed the reins of the Admiralty in 1941, and pursued a long-term policy for the Royal Navy to convert the fleet to depend exclusively on oil to power its ships, which was to have severe consequences on the coal industry in Wales.\n\nDuring the premiership of Labour’s Harold Wilson in the 1960s, Energy Minister Anthony Wedgwood Ben (before he became Tony Ben and a socialist) closed hundreds of coal mines in Wales, putting 100,000 miners out of work to pursue a policy of generating nuclear power.\n\nIt is ironic that it was Labour’s nuclear power plants that enabled Margaret Thatcher to crush the miners’ strike in 1985, and close the remaining collieries in Wales with no resistance from Neil Kinnock’s impotent Labour Party.\n\nThese sad episodes are an indictment that the Westminster system and the Labour Party does not work for Wales.\n\nIlltyd ap Dafydd\n\nNantyffyllon, Maesteg\n\nLook out for telltale diabetes symptoms\n\nI am writing to let readers know that it is vital to look out for the symptoms of Type 1 diabetes in their loved ones.\n\nLosing a child is beyond anyone’s worst nightmare, but sadly our son Peter died when he was just 13 after a late diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes. It’s something that no family should have to go through and now it’s our mission to make sure that parents and medical professionals have the symptoms of this condition at the front of their minds.\n\nThis is why we’re working with Diabetes UK Cymru on a new campaign called Know Type 1, to make everyone aware of the symptoms. They are easy to remember as the 4Ts – toilet, thirsty, tired and thinner. If you spot any of these symptoms, go to your GP and ask for an immediate finger prick blood glucose test, which takes less than a minute.\n\nType 1 diabetes can be easily mistaken for viral infections or other illnesses. Peter was very unwell with a chest infection, which made the symptoms of his Type 1 diabetes harder to identify. Despite showing typical symptoms of Type 1 diabetes like extreme fatigue, weight-loss, and frequent need to go to the toilet, Peter was not diagnosed until he was already seriously ill.\n\nBeing able to recognise the symptoms, get a quick diagnosis and early treatment could save your child’s life. The Know Type 1 campaign is Peter’s legacy, and it’s all about helping as many other families as we can. So please remember the symptoms, talk about them to your friends and join us to raise awareness of this serious condition.\n\nBeth Baldwin\n\nDiabetes UK Cymru supporter\n\nBrexit talks have left Wales out in the cold\n\nThe Democratic Unionist Party broke off talks with Theresa May this week, telling her to spend £2bn in Northern Ireland if she wants the party to prop up her minority Conservative Government. The DUP demanded the cash – which works out as £1,100 per person in the Province – as talks veered dangerously close to breaking down altogether.\n\nWales is firmly back of the queue – the Severn tolls weren’t even mentioned in the Queen’s Speech. With London’s focus on stopping Scotland leaving the Union and Northern Ireland getting this extra money and a soft Brexit to keep the north-south border open, this means Welsh ports will be overlooked, as all transport would go through Belfast and on to Liverpool. Wales could be looking at further job losses in these ports if it has a hard Brexit.\n\nAndrew Nutt\n\nBargoed\n\nWilliam Hague’s bad decisions overlooked\n\nWhile Theresa May is being humiliated, even by her own party, for her failure to deliver the manifesto, nothing is being said of former Foreign Secretary William Hague, who advised Mrs May to call a snap election. The same person who advised Cameron to invade Syria.\n\nJack Kearns\n\nGlynneath	2017-06-26 11:40:18.990551+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	50	761

1120	Freedom before liberalism		http://www.spiked-online.com/pettit.jpg	http://www.spiked-online.com/spiked-review/article/freedom-before-liberalism/\n19864\n	\N	So that’s one reason why the idea of freedom as non-interference took off, I think – it justified colonial power.\nThe new way of thinking of freedom as non-interference is welcomed because it justifies the power of employers over employees.\nIronically, those who really develop the idea of freedom as non-interference are the utilitarians, who cannot be described as being right-wing.\nThe idea of republican freedom applied to women would require equality in marriage, and of course the possibility of divorce.\nCould you say a bit more about why democracy is so important to ensuring the flourishing of republican freedom?	So that’s one reason why the idea of freedom as non-interference took off, I think – it justified colonial power. But it also justifies the power of employers in the new industrial period, a period during which all the traditional laws about how a master could treat journeymen or apprentices had become obsolete. Thousands of people were heading to the cities, to gain employment in these new factories. The employers, as we all know, do a blacklist, so if any of them fires someone, that fired employee is put on a blacklist, and probably can’t get a job. So the employers have enormous power over their workers.\n\nIn the older republican terms, that would have been really shocking, because even if the employers are nice to their workers, they’re still in a position of power in relation to the workers, and, worse than that, they can put them on a blacklist at will. The new way of thinking of freedom as non-interference is welcomed because it justifies the power of employers over employees. So if a worker signs a contract, formally or informally, to enter employment, he is agreeing to the terms of the relationship, and it doesn’t matter that it’s a relationship in which you’ve got a master, and you’re effectively a slave. That would have been anathema to the republican tradition.\n\nIronically, those who really develop the idea of freedom as non-interference are the utilitarians, who cannot be described as being right-wing. They’re all for reform and equality of people. Bentham – who argues each to count for one and none for more than one – is a great egalitarian. And what I think motivates Bentham and the theologian William Paley, who’s another significant utilitarian thinker in the 1780s, is that they want equality, but realise that if you hold on to the old notion of freedom as non-domination, then, wow, you’ve really got a powder keg on your hands, because it would overturn master-servant law, the relationship of employer to employee and family law. So I think that they’re under pressure to dilute this idea of freedom, turning it from this richer idea of non-domination to that of laissez faire non-interference. And then they can push their own agenda without it appearing too revolutionary.\n\nreview: You do also make a very strong argument in favour of freedom of choice…\n\nPettit: So in the republican tradition, as I understand it, the focus is on the person, and on the freedom of the person. But in order for a person to be free, two things have to be true. The person has to live under a law that gives him or her a range of choice or discretion in decision-making, where they really can act just as they wish. This is his or her area of independence under the law. Of course, people will always enter relationships, which means they are dependent on others. And that’s fine, so long as they reach out to one another for those relationships from a position of strength, where they really do have this area of independence under the law.\n\nOne reason why the idea of freedom as non-interference took off, I think, was because it justified colonial power\n\nThe second thing that’s needed is that they have to be politically as well as socially free, meaning that the law under which they are personally protected in this space is a law controlled by them equally with others. So they share a system of control over the law. Now that maps on to a notion of democracy.\n\nBut in the tradition as I read it, what’s really important is not just that you have elections – and you do have elections in Rome, as you did referenda – you also have a power of challenging what is happening in the law, through the courts, through demonstrations, by whatever means – the Romans call it provocatio, a right of appealing against the law. So it was never just that you are restricted to the right of the community voting. It also means to challenge a law, and to call for a rehearing of it, so to speak.\n\nreview: You mentioned dependence, or rather ‘dependence on others’, which a is tricky idea in relation to ideas of freedom, because, on the one hand, advocates of freedom would want to defend an idea of independence. But, on the other hand, being dependent on others, perhaps informally, on friends or family, or on others more broadly, to enable or to help you to achieve something, seems like it actually enriches our freedom. So are there forms of dependence that help people to be free?\n\nPettit: This is a really important point. The sort of independence that is important in the republican tradition, as the 17th-century theoretician and parliamentarian, Algernon Sidney, put it, ‘consists in independency upon the will of another’. It’s all about being independent from what others want you to do in a particular area of choice. So you’re guaranteed by the law, and by your informal powers and resources and the support of the community, to be able, if you wish, to act according to your own will in the relevant area of choice – let’s call it the fundamental liberties – regardless of what other people might want you to do. It’s independent of what others will you to do.\n\nNow that, of course, is completely consistent with being dependent on others for the opportunities you have. So I’m travelling to Sidney by bus tomorrow. That’s available to me because of other people – because other people like to travel, bus travel is a mode they are willing to pay for. So I’m dependent in a generic way on other people. That’s not inimical to the idea of of freedom as non-domination. Equally, personal relationships which you choose – relationships of friendship, of love, of commitment – are relationships in which, of course, we do become dependent on others. You don’t just ignore your partner, so to speak, and do whatever you like in the realm of basic liberties. It’s part of having an intimate relationship that you develop a common mind together. But that sort of dependency is chosen. And I would say that you don’t get proper relations of intimacy, proper dependencies and intimacies, unless they are entered from a position of strength.\n\nSo if you go back 100 years, when women were totally dependent on a father or a husband to look after them, at least in the middle part of life. They were in a position of great weakness entering romantic relationships. It’s no coincidence that men abused those relationships in a way that women didn’t. Men wore the trousers, as it were. So while women may not have been interfered with – and liberal freedom means non-interference – they endured a great imbalance of power, and lived, even with a gentle husband, under the husband’s thumb.\n\nFor democracy to flourish, above all you need an active citizenry, which will hold the government to account, ‘to keep the bastards honest’\n\nThe example I always use to illustrate freedom as non-domination is that of Nora and Torvald from Ibsen’s A Doll’s House. It’s set at a point in Norway’s history when women have little legal power. The man has it all: he owns everything; he can dictate whether his wife leaves the house, what she wears, who she associates with. But Torvald dotes on Nora. She is given everything. She really does enjoy freedom as non-interference in the classically liberal sense. What she absolutely does not enjoy is freedom as non-domination in the older republican sense (although of course in the Roman sense it wasn’t applied to women). The idea of republican freedom applied to women would require equality in marriage, and of course the possibility of divorce. It’s no coincidence that John Milton, who was a great republican thinker, wrote strongly in favour of divorce, recognising that in relationships that you can’t exit, you’re going to get domination if one of the parties was of a particular psychological disposition to dominate.\n\nAnd this is a key point: there’s a personal dimension to being a free person, and a political dimension to being a free person. In each case, being a free person means not being stood over; it means not suffering dominatio, which was the word the Romans used for the relationship of the slave to a master, a dominus. It means not suffering that sort of subordination to another. In personal life, it means you’ve got to have an area where you are the boss, even if you choose to bring other people as intimates into that area. And in the political dimension, you’ve got to have a standing of equals with others when it comes to seeking influence over the state, seeking to contest laws and so on.\n\nreview: You write that it’s important that the state ‘guards against itself practising a form of public domination’. Which is where democracy comes in. Could you say a bit more about why democracy is so important to ensuring the flourishing of republican freedom?\n\nPettit: The state, even in the most democratic, communal states, is a corporate agent with enormous power over us. States do have to exist, and they have to be coercive. That’s like gravity – it’s the background to society. Now, how states exercise their power – let’s think of the domestic state – over their citizens is really crucial to the quality of life those citizens enjoy. You can think of this in terms of respect for freedom. So the state has to give respect as equals to all its citizens, meaning more or less permanent, adult, able-minded members of a political community. And it has to respect them as equals. Now that does mean that the decisions of the state, which are always intrusive, because the state is essentially coercive, have to be shaped and disciplined and controlled on terms that appeal across society. So, for example, in a society in which the citizenry is equally protected and empowered, they’re always going to value equality. So any breach in the equal treatment of people is extremely disrespectful. And it means those treated unequally are obviously subject to a dominating state power, because it’s singling them out.\n\nI think that what is really, really essential to a properly democratic state is that it is controlled equally on the people’s terms. You have to have elections; they have to be periodic; they have to be free. But I think it’s equally important that apart from that electoral side, democracy must have a strong contestatory side. And the contestatory side requires two things. On the side on the state, it requires a great deal of sharing of power between different centres of power that can hold one another to account. So, for example, you need an electoral commission that can dictate the boundaries according to which politicians are elected, rather than allowing those politicians to do it themselves – a straightforward abuse that routinely occurs in the US. You’ve got to have auditors that can look at the books of government. You’ve got to have publicity, for instance, of economic data, and so on, which can be scrutinised. You also have to have a central bank that has a relative degree of independence, because politicians have such powerful interests in these areas. You need the courts to be clearly independent. And all of this needs to be transparent, so you need a media.\n\nThe state, even in the most democratic, communal states, is a corporate agent with enormous power over us\n\nBut above all you need an active citizenry, which will hold the government to account, ‘to keep the bastards honest’, as they say in Australia. The reason I’m emphasising this is that there are many on the left, which is my side of the divide, who think we need a more and more inclusive electoral style of democracy. Of course, it’s really important that we have democracy, which is control by the people on their terms. That requires something of far greater complexity than simply some notion of the popular will being imposed on government. There isn’t such a thing as the popular will. What you have to have are the channels by which people with different complaints from different sections of society can keep the sand in the wheels, which otherwise might run a little too smoothly in the direction of those in power.\n\nNow all of this requires transparency, and the involvement of the people, not just at the moments of elections or referenda, but by demonstrations, by the media. What I’m sketching is a multidimensional democracy, of which elections are only one part. You need lots of networks, ways of proposing things, ways of challenging things, to-ing and fro-ing, interacting\n\nI would at this point like to make clear my objection to referenda. In particular, I think it was a great abuse to have an up-down referendum on the membership of the EU. Many people had made plans for their whole lives, even acquiring a certain education (learning a language, for instance), on the assumption they would belong to this larger European bloc. It meant that those people represented an important group who were deeply invested in an arrangement that appeared pretty unshakeable. Now I don’t say that people can’t leave a treaty like that, but the decision to pull out of an arrangement of this order should not be made on the basis of what amounted to tossing a coin. We all know that referenda like that are likely to be influenced by collateral sorts of factors that are not germane to the question at issue, namely EU membership. A decision that is going to undermine the lives of a whole sector of the population should not be made on the basis of a one-off, up-down referendum. There are lots of ways it could have been done. One very simple one is to insist on a majority of 60 per cent or over, or to require two referenda, the second incorporating responses to the first.\n\nIn the 18th century, which was the great republican century, people designed constitutions so as to avoid these kinds of decisions. Even Rousseau argued that when making an up-down decision of this kind, the decision-making process must be slowed down somehow. The model for all those drawing up constitutions during the 18th century was, of course, Britain’s. But, ironically, because the British constution was never itself written down, procedures were never introduced for making major infrastructural changes, which is what leaving the EU amounts to. So now there’s this tendency to say, let’s have a referendum, let the people speak. Which is a rubbish understanding of democracy.\n\nreview: The EU isn’t exactly a shining embodiment of democracy…\n\nPettit: I wasn’t saying for one moment that the EU was the perfect democracy. It’s very imperfect indeed, because it’s not clear whether it’s a federation of states acting as states, or a federation of peoples who belong as much to the EU as to their own state. The EU’s a bit of a mess, and the Eurozone was a terrible idea. So I’m very critical of the EU in lots of ways.\n\nDemocracy, from day to day, is a hurly burly, messy business, with people shouting at one another\n\nI’m going to sound like a hoary old conservative now, but democracy only works really well in the longer term. Slow democracy rather than fast democracy. And I think referenda are examples of fast democracy.\n\nDemocracy, from day to day, is a hurly burly, messy business, with people shouting at one another. Rome was like that, too. Cicero talks of the ‘tumult of the crowd’, of their irrepressibility and so on. But Machiavelli was right: that was what was good about Rome, the fact that there was all this tumult and hurly burly. That is what kept the government on their toes.\n\nBut it’s what happens over the longer term that tells us whether democracy is in a good way, whether ideas gain traction among the people, as has happened in many democracies – ideas of equality, of health-provision entitlement, judicious security, social security… All of these ideas have emerged and stabilised only as a result of the hurly burly of day-to-day democracy over the longer term. The success of democracy lies in the laying down of foundations, the establishment of ideas according to which governments cannot be tyrannical or despotic.\n\nPhilip Pettit is LS Rockefeller professor of politics and human values at Princeton University.

1121	Reimagining social hope		http://www.spiked-online.com/aronson.jpg	http://www.spiked-online.com/spiked-review/article/reimagining-social-hope/\n19868\n	\N	Was there a kernel of social hope in his election victory?\nThat part of his writing really inspired my own work and is embedded in what I’m trying to describe as social hope.\nDo you remain positive about a reimagining of social hope?\nI was exploring our roots – what is the basis within us for reconnecting with a deeper sense of social hope that motivated past generations?\nHe is the author, most recently, of We: Reviving Social Hope, published by University of Chicago Press.	Whelan: Where has this feeling of an obsession with the individual come from? It’s always dangerous to reduce the 1960s, which encompassed the diverse aspirations of the New Left as well as the counter-culture. But, overall do you think that there was perhaps too much of a tendency to make the personal political, and self-esteem central? Has that led, in part, to this crises of individuality – this obsession with individuality?\n\nAronson: You’re making a good point, and you want to press me on this, which is good. Because I wrote in the 1960s on behalf of that individualism, feeling that that individualism was potentially revolutionary. The 1960s was central to my own development and my own writing and thinking and acting. It was a rebellion against the conformity of the earlier period. I mentioned Brave New World and Nineteen Eighty-Four and We. There are two other books that are part of that stream that most people don’t usually consider. One is Allen Ginsberg’s Howl, which was this massive poem about the struggle for individual survival and integrity in the totalitarian society. And then, there’s Herbert Marcuse’s One-Dimensional Man, which is about a society without opposition. There’s barely a space for authentic individualism in that book. So, you might say there was a rebellion, in part, on behalf of the need for individual identity and flourishing.\n\nYou’re not saying this, but I think often a very cheap and easy way to describe it is to simply say: ‘Well that individualism has gone too far and it led to neoliberalism’. And there is something in that, except that the individualism, as it developed, immediately got seized upon by the capitalism system as a way of ensuring profit and economic growth. It’s not simply that individuals have gone too far, but that individuals have also lost a sense of collectivity. It’s a sense that you have no responsibility beyond yourself.\n\nThe genesis of this is complex. There is an element in the 1960s, but the element in the economic system is crucial – and in the consumer society, as part of what makes up this privatisation of hope I describe. The ideology is a big part – the ideology of what we call right-wing think-tanks, neoliberal think-tanks and neoliberal ideologists in the US and the UK. They promote a way of thinking which is quite magical – which says that individuals on their own will somehow magically produce the best result for society. That’s way beyond what we envisioned in the 1960s. It’s more deeply to do with the needs of the current economic system.\n\nWhelan: What do you make of the contemporary obsession with self-invention and reinvention? The end point of much of that movement in the 1960s now isn’t just about neoliberalism, it’s this individualistic obsession with defining and presenting ourselves. Do you think it’s a problem that identity and individuality now is all about how you express yourself?\n\nAronson: There’s quite a problem there. Sociologists like Zygmunt Bauman and even Anthony Giddens and Ulrich Beck have talked about this risk to society, in the way in which it individualised society. It does exactly what you’re talking about – individuals become obsessed with who they are, writing their biography. There’s an incredibly sharp self consciousness about inventing myself and reinventing myself. What is all that about? What is going on there?\n\nI wrote in the 1960s on behalf of individualism, feeling that that individualism was potentially revolutionary\n\nWell, if you look at it closely, it’s a social process. There are social demands made on individuals to do that. The social demands come from the labour market. Individuals have demands made on them – the whole outpouring of various types of pop psychology in which people turn inward to themselves – all this is part of a historical wave. If people spent as much time thinking about their society as they do about themselves individually, we might be able to imagine a balance. But we’re so far from any point of balance. The question might be: how do you combine individual sensibility and self-development with a social awareness and social participation? Well, if we were raised and educated to do both, it might happen. If we had a sense of ourselves as personal individuals, and as belonging to a larger society at the same time, things would be very different. We absolutely do belong, and people need to become aware of it.\n\nBut people are becoming aware of it, in the UK and the US, in both good ways and bad. The bad being the Trump movement, and UKIP. The good being the movements that generated support for Bernie Sanders and the shocking support behind Jeremy Corbyn. People totally didn’t expect a return to a wider sense of community, and that is happening too.\n\nWhelan: You brought up the good and the bad – let’s look at what you consider to be the bad. Like the sociologist Arlie Hochschild, you don’t simply condemn the rise of Trump, and paint his supporters as angry white men, as so many other commentators seek to do. Was there a kernel of social hope in his election victory? Even just in its rejection of the business as usual politics?\n\nAronson: No. That would be similar to asking if there is there a kernel of hope in fascism. But there is something there in the support for Trump. It’s the rejection of the neoliberals in the Republican Party and the Democratic Party – the rejection of leaving people on their own. (Which is the strongest ideology of the other Republican candidates opposed to Trump.) No one really seriously thought about our society and the inequalities that had occurred or the social devastation of the past decade. Trump addressed that, and in that sense, people are saying something is wrong and something has to change. I call that a distorting mirror of hope. It’s hope where you say something has to change – but you say he has to change it. I call it an anti-hope, because you want the great man to come in and solve your problems, instead of some collective movement to find the social sources of the problem and collectively act to make a difference. I know that sounds very much like old-style socialism, but that’s what Bernie Sanders brought back; a politics where we collectively make a difference to democratise society and to search for meaningful social changes that are effective for everybody.\n\nWe make choices, always. We create ourselves, always. But, as Sartre later understood it, under conditions not of our own making and not of our own control\n\nWhelan: Okay, so you argue that Trump wants to act alone, not with a collective. But don’t you think there is potential, simply in the raw rejection of the establishment in the Trump vote, for change? Can the US left harness that?\n\nAronson: Yes – in the resistance against Trump. From within it, all sorts of possibilities are bubbling up. People see themselves as acting together. There is a ‘we’ versus the ‘him’. People see themselves as within a large social movement. It’s not just a matter of defending, for example, Obamacare, which is a very incomplete, partial healthcare system. But, within that, the natural solution to the healthcare crisis that Trump is worsening would be medicare for all – a single-payer national healthcare system. People are saying that – large numbers of people are saying that. So, we see a movement beginning to raise demands for large-scale social change that would benefit everybody. I think that’s built into the anti-Trump resistance. Many people see it moving in that direction. There’s a real possibility there.\n\nWhelan: I want to bring in your previous work now, because your life-long intellectual interest in Sartre is fascinating in this context. What would Sartre make of the ‘psychotherapeutic injunction’, as you put it, ‘to take command of our own lives and become the active subjects of our stories’?\n\nAronson: Well, Sartre sees, particularly in the Critique of Dialectical Reason, and in his later works, the serialised, isolated, separated, individual. An individual who is dominated in that separation and isolation. It’s not just a natural state; it’s a state in which one is passive in relation to the larger social world. Sartre sees that individual under threat, looking around to find other individuals, coming together collectively to find a means to deal with the crises. Sartre very much understood that and wrote about it. That part of his writing really inspired my own work and is embedded in what I’m trying to describe as social hope. That is to say, collectives functioning collectively and overcoming that isolation and separation.\n\nWhelan: How would you assess Sartre’s philosophy of freedom now?\n\nAronson: Well, it’s still there. Sartre’s analysis is still there in that stage of individual development and intellectual understanding. Those stages are still very much there – they’re part of us – they’re part of you and I. So they’re presupposed in everything we do. We make choices, always. We create ourselves, always. But, as Sartre later understood it, under conditions not of our own making and not of our own control. Just as he moved from the understanding of how we make ourselves to an understanding of the conditions under which we make ourselves, and the tools that we are given (sometimes very paltry tools), to make ourselves. He understood the deeper social layers of the process. So, I think we have to take his initial, very striking and important ideas on board, and continue as he did to understanding and struggling in the larger society.\n\nWhelan: Your book is very positive, you talk about the possibility and potential for social change. You write that if somebody like Bernie Sanders can come out of nowhere and make such an intervention, anything can happen. Do you remain positive about a reimagining of social hope?\n\nAronson: I was writing the book in the deepest period of cynicism after Barack Obama’s hope phase. I was exploring our roots – what is the basis within us for reconnecting with a deeper sense of social hope that motivated past generations? And, lo and behold, in 2016, we saw that process happen. Albeit in a false, distorting and mirrored way. But it also happened in a very positive, democratic, collective way with Bernie Sanders. I saw reality proving what I was talking about in my book. So, the postscript in the book is about the 2016 election and Trump. The book really points towards the anti-Trump resistance as the path for recreating hope. Both Bernie and Jeremy Corbyn seem to me to be at least the harbingers of something really new, based on a refusal to let go of our sense of social belonging.\n\nProfessor Ronald Aronson is professor emeritus of the History of Ideas at Wayne State University.

1122	The puzzle of identity		http://www.spiked-online.com/descombes.jpg	http://www.spiked-online.com/spiked-review/article/the-puzzle-of-identity/\n19875\n	\N	As French philosopher Vincent Descombes explains in his newly translated book, Puzzling Identities, this is a distinctly modern question.\nAnd so familiar are we today with the question of identity, the question of my identity, that we barely interrogate the meaning of the question.\nHe looks at how the question of identity – ‘who is he?’ – was originally little more than a third-person inquiry.\nThere are other biographical details which further identify Vincent Descombes as that Vincent Descombes.\nBut the question of identity, the question of who someone is, has acquired a deeper, first-person sense.	Who am I? As French philosopher Vincent Descombes explains in his newly translated book, Puzzling Identities, this is a distinctly modern question. Of course, it looks simple enough. And so familiar are we today with the question of identity, the question of my identity, that we barely interrogate the meaning of the question.\n\nBut that is precisely what Descombes does in the first part of Puzzling Identities. He looks at how the question of identity – ‘who is he?’ – was originally little more than a third-person inquiry. It is the type of question the reader might well be asking now: who is Vincent Descombes? We can say that he was born in 1943. We can say he is a professor of philosophy at the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales in Paris. We can say, too, that he is an author of several prized works, beginning with Le Même et l’Autre, which was published in English in 1980 as Modern French Philosophy. There are other biographical details which further identify Vincent Descombes as that Vincent Descombes. He studied philosophy and sociology at the Sorbonne in the 1960s, for instance, and, while there, he was a member of the anti-Stalinist Marxist group, Socialisme ou Barbarie.\n\nSo far, so Wikipedia. But the question of identity, the question of who someone is, has acquired a deeper, first-person sense. It is no longer simply the elementary question of us establishing who he or she is, from their name and date of birth, to their occupation and interests; it is also a moral-psychological question for me or you to attempt to answer for ourselves, a subjective project, an individual quest for that identity for which we want to be recognised, valued and esteemed. And as such, it is often a difficult, vexed question, one experienced by adolescents, for instance, as a problem as they struggle between the values of their parents and those, perhaps, of their peers, or better still, an ‘identity crisis’ to use the famous formulation of Erik Erikson, who plays such a prominent role in Puzzling Identities.\n\nWhat happened?, I ask Descombes over email. How did ‘who am I?’, a question that, as he argues, wouldn’t have made any sense to an Ancient Athenian or, indeed a Medieval peasant, come to be a defining question of the modern age, generating endless self-presentation on social media, and fuelling the ceaseless demand for recognition of who I am? What was it that prompted Oscar Wilde to predict that, while ‘“Know thyself” was written over the portal of the Antique world, over the portal of the new world, “Be thyself” shall be written’. Descombes’ initial answer is pithy: ‘Between Pericles and us, something took place: Christianity has been active. It has extended to all human beings without exception the concern for personal salvation.’\n\nWhat distinguishes modern man from traditional man is his refusal to invest his literal identity with a normative function\n\nDescombes is right, of course. Christianity did make the question of one’s salvation or, indeed, damnation, a personal concern, a matter of outward devotion and inward faith. In Puzzling Identities, he cites Hegel from Outlines of the Philosophy of Right (1820): ‘The right of the subject’s particularity, his right to be satisfied, or in other words the right of subjective freedom, is the pivot and centre of the difference between antiquity and modern times. This right in its infinity is given expression in Christianity and it has become the universal effective principle of a new form of the world.’\n\nHegel’s ‘right of subjective freedom’ is roughly equivalent to what we might think of today as individualism. It is the right of the individual to formulate and act upon his or her own conception of what he deems to be good - his ‘right to be satisfied’. But the question of identity is more than that. It is a form of subjective freedom, but its object is not salvation, or even the good; its object is the self itself. In other words, it is the right of the individual to formulate his or her own conception of his or her self.\n\nI ask Descombes to expand on the reasons for this development, beyond the advent of Christianity. His answer seems to rest on the changes that occur in the shift from the politically mediated relations operative under feudalism to the freer, economically mediated relations of capitalism. Or the ‘great disembedding’, as he calls it. His response is worth quoting in full:\n\n‘Just as [the philosopher] Charles Taylor does, I draw the idea of “the great disembedding” from Karl Polanyi’s The Great Transformation (1944), where it applies to the fact that the economy has been conceived as an independent system, governed by its own laws and inherently able to find by itself its point of equilibrium. In Polanyi’s thought, the transformation he is telling us about boils down to a differentiation between the domain of economy (a domain governed by natural laws) and the domain of politics.\n\n‘Now, Taylor gives to the term a new application by describing the modern individual as somehow “disembedded” from the social fabric in which he is born and has been raised. Here, Taylor is following the anthropologist Louis Dumont who, in From Mandeville to Marx (1977), integrated Polanyi’s views into a general account of the process generating us, modern individuals, out of pre-modern human beings. Dumont points out that in Ancient times and during the Middle Ages, it was not impossible to become an independent individual, but that there was a price to pay for such an emancipation. The price to be paid at the time of the Roman Empire was becoming a paradoxical philosopher – such as the Stoics.	2017-06-26 11:40:25.784024+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	53	767	
1123	The ideal of autonomy		http://www.spiked-online.com/furedi_auto.jpg	http://www.spiked-online.com/spiked-review/article/the-ideal-of-autonomy/\n19867\n	\N	Its assumption that through self-governance the life of a community would flourish underwrote the development of the modern ideal of autonomy.\nHence, in order to respect people’s moral autonomy, tolerance towards social attitudes is as necessary as tolerance towards beliefs and opinions.\nEven at the best of times, individual autonomy is an ideal that can be realised inconsistently.\nBut the difficulties that stand in the way of realising personal autonomy do not negate this ideal.\nThat individuals sometimes fail to exercise autonomy or make choices that are against their interests, does not devalue this principle.	This important concept developed by the Greeks acquired a more compelling dimension with the development of a rationality-based moral philosophy in the 18th century. This philosophy elaborated on a morality based on self-governance by recognising the transformative power of reason.\n\nThis was an optimistic cultural outlook that believed that all human beings had the potential for understanding what was morally valuable. Its assumption that through self-governance the life of a community would flourish underwrote the development of the modern ideal of autonomy.\n\nMoral independence\n\nAn autonomous person is presumed to possess moral independence – that is, he or she can act with moral responsibility. Through the exercise of autonomy, people can develop their personality by assuming responsibility for their lives. The cultivation of moral independence requires that people are free to deliberate and come to their own conclusions about the views and opinions they hear. As the philosopher Ronald Dworkin explained:\n\n‘Government insults its citizens, and denies their moral responsibility, when it decrees that they cannot be trusted to hear opinions that might persuade them to dangerous or offensive convictions. We retain our dignity, as individuals, only by insisting that no one – no official and no majority – has the right to withhold an opinion from us on the grounds that we are not fit to hear and consider it.’\n\nThrough reflecting freely on opinions and deciding for ourselves what is good and bad, we learn to behave as responsible and independent citizens. In the course of such deliberations, people not only forge their own opinions but also influence the views of others. The exercise of moral responsibility thus possesses an active dimension insofar as we seek to communicate our views to our fellow citizens.\n\nThe exercise of moral autonomy requires that people are able to be themselves, act in accordance with their inclinations and tastes, and feel free to adopt a lifestyle that allows them to express their personality. As Dworkin stated, ‘citizens have as much right to contribute to the formation of the moral or aesthetic climate as they do to participate in politics’. Hence, in order to respect people’s moral autonomy, tolerance towards social attitudes is as necessary as tolerance towards beliefs and opinions. Or, as another philosopher, Joseph Raz, wrote, ‘autonomy requires that many morally acceptable, though incompatible, forms of life be available to a person’.\n\nFreedom constrained\n\nValuing autonomy doesn’t reflect a naive, populist belief that the public can do no wrong. Millions of people continue to fall prey to conspiracy theories, prejudices and irrational influences. Even at the best of times, individual autonomy is an ideal that can be realised inconsistently. People live in a world not of their own making and in circumstances that often elude their aspiration to determine their own affairs. The exercise of autonomy has always come up against external constraints – natural obstacles, economic exigencies, wars, conflict and social dislocation. Today, it also faces a cultural climate that is deeply suspicious of the aspiration for autonomous behaviour.\n\nThe recognition that autonomy is morally valuable and that people’s attempts to make their own lives should be respected does not mean that people always make the right choices for themselves. Nor should an ideal be confused with the attempt to realise it. Formidable obstacles always stand in the way of individuals who wish to be the authors of their own lives.\n\nBut the difficulties that stand in the way of realising personal autonomy do not negate this ideal. People possess the potential for making their own lives. As with all freedoms, how autonomy is exercised and whether its potential is reached depend on specific circumstances. As Dworkin points out, there is a clear distinction to be made between the ‘general point or value of autonomy and its consequences for a particular person on a particular occasion’.\n\nIt is precisely because autonomy is difficult to achieve that a democratic society must foster a climate that is hospitable to individual, social and political experimentation. Even in the most difficult of circumstances, it is important to act on the presumption that people have a capacity for autonomy. Why? Because, though we cannot choose who we are, we can still possess a measure of freedom to choose what we do.\n\nLike all the ideals that are associated with freedom, moral independence cannot be taken for granted. It needs to be lived and fought for. That individuals sometimes fail to exercise autonomy or make choices that are against their interests, does not devalue this principle. Striving for autonomy is inextricably linked to the development of the human potential.\n\nThe intimate connection between humanity and autonomy was recognised by the Greek philosopher Aristotle, whose vision of human flourishing emphasised self-direction and choice. Aristotle claimed that it was through the self-directed activity of making choices and evaluating these experiences that individuals can cultivate the virtues necessary to lead a good life.\n\nFree choice\n\nAll too often, the significance of making choices is trivialised by critics who regard it as the functional equivalent of going shopping and choosing one brand over another. Critics of choice sometimes argue that most people aren’t presented with real choices, and that therefore autonomy is an illusion.\n\nWhat critics of autonomy fail to grasp is that, whatever the obstacles that stand in the way of freely determined action, humanity can only act responsibly through striving for autonomy. It is difficult to hold ourselves or others to account for choices that we assume are not of our own making. From this perspective, the right to choose is not simply important for the flourishing of the individual concerned. Freely determined action develops our capacity to make judgements and to act on them, and, in turn, we become accountable for our actions to others. The corollary of the right to choose is the willingness to be held responsible for the consequences of our choices.\n\nMoral independence, accomplished through the right to choose, is integral to a genuinely human vision of freedom. Autonomy, which is realised through an independent exercise of judgement, can only flourish in a society that trusts its citizens. That is why, in the end, how we view choice is determined by whether or not we trust each other as members of a common moral universe.\n\nFrank Furedi is a sociologist and commentator.

1124	The strange death of liberal Europe		http://www.spiked-online.com/images/hungary_fence.jpg	http://www.spiked-online.com/spiked-review/article/the-strange-death-of-liberal-europe/\n19861\n	\N	In Britain, the experience of Ray Honeyford in criticising the problem of parallel communities was telling.\nBut the sharpest cause of concern over parallel communities was the increasing tally of Islamist terrorist attacks involving people born and brought up in Europe.\nThe vacillation of Europe’s leaders was epitomised by Merkel’s response to the migrant crisis in 2015: ‘We can do this’ (‘Wir schaffen das’).\nThe European public continues to have a sense of these collective interests, but they are mostly unknown and unarticulated by Europe’s political class.\nFollow him on Twitter: @JonHolbThe Strange Death of Europe: Immigration, Identity, Islam, by Douglas Murray, is published by Bloomsbury Continuum.	The weakness of European political culture in the postwar era was evident in the absence of any notion that it was even possible to expect immigrants to endorse liberal democracy. Immigration, in the absence of assimilation, inevitably meant that parallel communities developed. And having discounted the possibility of assimilating immigrants, Europe’s leaders were left with two options: either curtail immigration and encourage repatriation or ignore the problem. Enoch Powell’s infamous ‘Rivers of Blood’ speech in 1968 was an attempt to do the former. He warned that Britain was ‘mad, literally mad… to be permitting the annual inflow of some 50,000 dependants’. He said this immigration was ‘like watching a nation busily engaged in heaping up its own funeral pyre’.\n\nPowell was immediately relieved of his position in the shadow cabinet, and his political career was over. But instead of giving rise to a debate about how to assimilate immigrants, the sidelining of Powell gave political leaders an easy way of silencing any debate on immigration: dismiss it as racist, or – and this amounted to the same thing – dismiss it as Powellite.\n\nWhen the problem of parallel communities could no longer be ignored, European societies entered the era of multiculturalism, an era that advocated an acceptance and celebration of cultural difference. Those who advocated a desire to see immigrants embrace liberal democracy were dealt with harshly. In Britain, the experience of Ray Honeyford in criticising the problem of parallel communities was telling. In 1984, Honeyford, the headmaster of a Bradford school, published an article noting the refusal of some Muslim fathers to permit their daughters to participate in dance classes, drama or sport, and the silence of the authorities on this and other cultural practices, such as taking children back to Pakistan during term time. He also argued for pupils to be encouraged to speak English and understand British culture.\n\nThe race-relations industry, which Honeyford had also criticised, organised a campaign against him and the Muslim mayor of Bradford claimed that, for his ‘cultural chauvinism’, Honeyford should be sacked. ‘Raycist’ Honeyford, as his critics dubbed him, was forced into early retirement for challenging parallel communities at a time when British politicians had abandoned any notion of assimilation in favour of its antithesis: multiculturalism.\n\nIn this second era, which started in the 1980s, European politicians made a virtue of their political weakness by implicitly recognising that their belief in liberal democracy was so lacking that they would promote the politics of difference, dressed up first as ‘multiculturalism’ and then as ‘diversity’. In this era, there were few Ray Honeyfords who were intellectually strong enough to challenge the problem of parallel communities in the face of politicians who furnished a race-relations industry with money and prestige to celebrate cultural difference.\n\nBut bad political ideas that go unchallenged by the political class will eventually be challenged by the public. And so it was that the advocates of multiculturalism generated a public backlash. In 2006, the Dutch justice minister, Piet Hein Donner, caused significant anger in the Netherlands when he suggested that Muslims could change Dutch law to Sharia by democratic means. There was at least equal public outrage in Britain when, in 2008, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, suggested that the adoption of elements of Sharia law in the UK ‘seems unavoidable’. Murray notes that ‘it suddenly seemed as though some of the absolute bases of Western civilisation were being offered up for negotiation’. In the early 2000s, stories that the Sikh and white working-class communities had been telling for years about the organised grooming of young girls by gangs of Muslim men started to be taken seriously by the media and police. But the sharpest cause of concern over parallel communities was the increasing tally of Islamist terrorist attacks involving people born and brought up in Europe.\n\nBad political ideas that go unchallenged by the political class will eventually be challenged by the public\n\nThe political leaders of Germany, Britain and France eventually responded. In October 2010, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, gave a state-of-the-nation speech in which she said, ‘Of course, the approach to build a multicultural society and to live side-by-side and to enjoy each other has failed, utterly failed’. That was why, she insisted, ‘integration is so important’ and immigrants in Germany must follow the laws and constitution of Germany and speak German.\n\nIn February 2011, Britain’s prime minister, David Cameron, gave a speech in Munich critical of ‘the doctrine of state multiculturalism’ by which ‘we have encouraged different cultures to live separate lives, apart from each other and apart from the mainstream’. A few days later, the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, also pronounced multiculturalism to be a ‘failure’, saying: ‘The truth is that in all our democracies we have been too preoccupied with the identity of those who arrived and not enough with the identity of the country that welcomed them.’\n\nAfter six decades of allowing and encouraging immigrants to live separate lives, the public had forced Europe’s leaders to change the narrative on immigration. Murray points out how extraordinary it was that it took 60 years of immigration before Europe’s political leaders even stated that immigrants should speak the language of the country they entered. And, just as striking, that during those six decades ‘such a demand would have been – and was – attacked as “racist”’.\n\nIn this new era, the gulf between the people and their leaders can no longer be ignored, but it still exists. Despite European leaders recognising that multiculturalism has failed, they lack a political perspective that can solve the immigration issue. The problem remains unresolved because, as David Cameron had recognised in his Munich speech, ‘We’ve failed to provide a vision of society to which they [immigrants] feel they want to belong’. In the absence of a vision, immigrants will continue to have little to assimilate into, and political leaders will fall back on lightweight reasons in favour of immigration, such as short-term economic expediency, misplaced guilt about global hardship, or simply the moral affirmation that comes from appearing to be nice.\n\nThe vacillation of Europe’s leaders was epitomised by Merkel’s response to the migrant crisis in 2015: ‘We can do this’ (‘Wir schaffen das’). But Merkel could not claim to be speaking for the German people, since the German public did not support more immigration, least of all an influx of one million asylum seekers in a year. Neither did she have any idea what ‘this’ referred to. But what mattered was that, as Merkel put it, ‘The world sees Germany as a land of hope and chances. And that wasn’t always the case.’ This was Germany’s chance to atone for the Second World War and to portray itself as a country that people would migrate into rather than flee from.\n\nIn the absence of ‘a vision of society’ that can command popular support, Europe’s leaders will continue to stumble from one migrant crisis to another because the immediate emotional claims of a migrant will tend to trump the collective interests of a nation. The European public continues to have a sense of these collective interests, but they are mostly unknown and unarticulated by Europe’s political class.\n\nLiberal democracy has many political foundations such as the separation of church and state, free speech, the equal rights of women and gays, democracy and the rule of law. Yet these ideas are alien to many immigrants, particularly Muslims, who come from different political cultures. Only a nation with a strong political culture that believes in these ideas can challenge those who do not accept them. A nation with a strong belief in liberal democracy would appreciate the need to assimilate immigrants to its political values, and it would not accept the existence of parallel communities. Least of all would it celebrate cultures with backward views on politics, religion, free speech, equal rights and so forth.\n\nMurray is a compelling writer who, in The Strange Death of Europe, has compiled an array of evidence and argument in support of his claim that ‘the movement of millions of people into a guilty, jaded and dying culture cannot’ work. As his colleague at the Spectator, Matthew Parris, says, he ‘writes so well that when he is wrong he is dangerous.’\n\nIn my opinion Murray’s conclusion is not wrong, but there is a difficulty for anyone tackling subjects as contentious as immigration, identity and Islam. And that is the relationship between cause and symptom. Immigrants are not the cause of Europe’s woes, and parallel communities are a symptom of Europe’s political weakness. Immigrants have never been required or incentivised to assimilate; indeed, since the 1980s, the politics of multiculturalism has incentivised them not to assimilate. Easy though it is to blame the immigrant (a mistake often made by the populist parties of Europe), those who criticise postwar immigration must never lose sight of the fact that the easy target is the wrong target.\n\nWhen reading Murray’s excellent book, it is worth remembering that, of his two arguments, it is the second that is causative of the first. In other words, it is because Europe is dying that immigration has become a politically fraught issue. The target of our anger has to be, not the immigrant, but our political leaders who, over six decades, have had so little belief in liberal democracy that they have never expected immigrants to assimilate to the political values that made Europe such a desirable place to live.\n\nJon Holbrook is a barrister He is giving a lecture on the Legal Subject as part of The Academy on 15 July 2017.

1125	Utopia for miserabilists		http://www.spiked-online.com/bregman.jpg	http://www.spiked-online.com/spiked-review/article/utopia-for-miserabilists/\n19862\n	\N	From the title onwards, Utopia for Realists is an exercise in sophistry.\nHe puts his proposals on a par with the historical campaigns for democracy, the abolition of slavery and women’s suffrage.\nBregman also makes the welcome argument that there is an alternative to the way the world currently runs.\nIn his view, the welfare state has become ‘a perverse behemoth of control and humiliation’.\nAlthough he devotes an entire chapter to this topic, he does not make the connection to the UBI explicit.	From the title onwards, Utopia for Realists is an exercise in sophistry. Despite the ample use of revolutionary rhetoric, the consequence of its proposals would be a hyper-austerity that would make the most hawkish free marketeer blush.\n\nLet’s start with the book’s outsized claims. Rutger Bregman, a 29-year-old Dutch writer, says the work is ‘an attempt to unlock the future’. He puts his proposals on a par with the historical campaigns for democracy, the abolition of slavery and women’s suffrage. So he certainly appears to have no shortage of ambition.\n\nBregman also makes the welcome argument that there is an alternative to the way the world currently runs. ‘Things could be different. The way our world is organised is not the result of some axiomatic evolution.’\n\nMore specifically, his big idea is that everyone, however rich or poor, should have a right to a universal basic income (UBI) paid by the state. ‘Free money for everyone’, as he prefers to call it. In this he claims to be following in the footsteps of a peculiar combination of luminaries, from democratic campaigners (Thomas Paine, Martin Luther King) to free-market economists (Milton Friedman, Friedrich Hayek) and disgraced politicians (US President Richard Nixon). Bregman argues that such a programme would lead to lower inequality, less poverty, lower crime rates and higher economic growth. To substantiate his case, he points to empirical studies mainly done by economists.\n\nRead Bregman’s book closely and it becomes apparent that what is really being suggested is a savage cut in living standards\n\nFor example, he starts his second chapter with an account of a research programme conducted on 13 homeless men in London a few years ago. A local charity gave the men £3,000 each in cash to spend as they wished. In Bregman’s account, the experiment was a resounding success. The lives of all 13 improved considerably in the year and a half after the experiment began. Moreover, the London homeless project saved a huge amount of money in terms of the costs of policing and welfare. This opens the way for his subsequent argument that a UBI could replace conventional social-security payments. In his view, the welfare state has become ‘a perverse behemoth of control and humiliation’. This argument has some truth to it although it understates the extent to which the welfare system in many countries has come to sap individual ambition and corrode social solidarity.\n\nBregman also claims that Westerners will be working 15-hour weeks by 2030.

1126	Crime fiction: a moral rebellion		http://www.spiked-online.com/detective_fiction.jpg	http://www.spiked-online.com/spiked-review/article/the-moral-case-for-crime-fiction/\n19859\n	\N	The English crime writer Dorothy L Sayers gave a lecture in Oxford in 1935, called ‘Aristotle on Detective Fiction’.\nThat two-way tension between rule-bound behaviour and moral righteousness is dramatically rich, even if it has more to do with character than plot.\nBut my second, the detective, is less concerned about people rising above the law than about the law imploding from within.\nThe rebel leaders are flawed, there are fifth columnists, and the rebellion never finally succeeds or fails.\nThat’s why crime fiction continues to beguile, even when it loses the plot.	And that brings us to the second objection to Chesterton’s defence of detective stories. Does the satisfaction of a mystery solved really have anything to do with morality? Or is it more aesthetic: the pleasing sense of everything coming together in the end, unlike in real life? Indeed, might neatly tied ends actually militate against the realism of a Chandler, who, even if unwittingly, reflected the reality that many murders remain unsolved? Perhaps the real ‘romance of the police force’ would be better dramatised without the aesthetic embellishment of mysteries solved, which, after all, rarely satisfies more than once.\n\nThen again, perhaps a writer who disdains the solving of mysteries has no business writing detective stories. The English crime writer Dorothy L Sayers gave a lecture in Oxford in 1935, called ‘Aristotle on Detective Fiction’. There she entertainingly applied the lessons of Aristotle’s Poetics to the detective story, taking it to be the contemporary form of classical tragedy (1). This was necessary because ‘today, we get many examples exhibiting a rather slender plot and a good deal of morbid psychology’ (reading this, the author of That Existential Leap shifts uncomfortably in his seat).\n\nChannelling Aristotle, Sayers insisted that plot must take precedence over character, and that plot developments should occur unexpectedly, but also in consequence of one another. The trick is to use paralogism – aka leading the reader up the garden path – so that readers are seduced by the wrong conclusions, even when the correct ones are in plain sight. As a result: ‘Even though at the end we are to feel surprise on discovering the identity of the criminal, we ought not to feel incredulity; we should rather be able to say to ourselves: “Yes, I can see now that from the beginning this man had it in him to commit murder, had I only had the wits to interpret the indications furnished by the author.”’\n\nI can’t help but wonder what Sayers (or Aristotle) would have made of the BBC crime drama Line of Duty, which recently finished its fourth series. Line of Duty combines compelling characters with internally coherent but wildly improbable plots, and straddles Deb’s British and American styles by focusing on a closed system of suspects, while gradually revealing a wider plot involving sinister unseen characters.\n\nFor me, the appeal is less in the tortuous plots than in the characters themselves. The main protagonists are not merely detectives, but anti-corruption detectives. Their suspects are fellow police officers. In most police dramas, especially American ones, the ‘rat squad’ is universally despised. It’s almost paradoxical: why should the police object to being policed? But it’s not quite a paradox, because the point is that as people committed to protecting the public, to being the good guys, cops tend to see themselves as a special case. It’s not that they don’t think seriously corrupt officers should be punished; it’s that they feel decent cops should be given the benefit of the doubt to get on with their jobs without undue interference.\n\nThe modern detective’s appeal often has more to do with his or her flaws than any particular virtue or integrity\n\nIntellectually, we can all see that won’t wash. There have to be rules and officers have to be accountable to them. But anti-corruption officers like the ones portrayed in Line of Duty have to embody that principle in a working culture defined by an us-and-them mentality. Having broken the informal rules of group loyalty, they have little choice but to revel in unpopularity, sacrificing the respect of their colleagues for the sake of Chesterton’s ‘most dark and daring of conspiracies’ – doing the right thing.\n\nThat two-way tension between rule-bound behaviour and moral righteousness is dramatically rich, even if it has more to do with character than plot. Superheroes are not bound by rules, after all. And even mere mortals sometimes think of ourselves as special cases. One major influence on That Existential Leap was Dostoevsky’s Crime and Punishment. The protagonist Raskolnikov decides he is an ‘extraordinary person’ and therefore has a kind of special licence to rise above the law and conventional morality, and even commit murder in pursuance of his own greatness\n\nThis idea appeals to my own first, criminal, protagonist. But my second, the detective, is less concerned about people rising above the law than about the law imploding from within. After a particularly sinister child murder, he is put in charge of a new unit to solve ‘occult crimes’, and soon begins to worry he has been put on a crusade that has nothing to do with criminal justice or morality. What happens, not when individuals refuse to subject themselves to the law, but when the law stops treating individuals as responsible subjects?\n\nThe cosmic conservatives DCI Alexander contends with are not just burglars and footpads, but well-meaning senior colleagues who are more interested in keeping the plot moving along than in anyone’s moral character. There is a good deal of morbid psychology, then, but I like to think some of the romance of man, too.\n\nPerhaps Chesterton was right. Detective stories do present us with a romantic rebellion against lawlessness. But that rebellion is more complicated than who killed the chauffeur. The rebel leaders are flawed, there are fifth columnists, and the rebellion never finally succeeds or fails. That’s why crime fiction continues to beguile, even when it loses the plot.\n\nDolan Cummings is a writer based in London. That Existential Leap: A Crime Story is published by Zero Books.

Hello. Here's your morning briefing:\n\nImage copyright AFP\n\nThe authorities have come under intense criticism over the Grenfell Tower fire, but Labour's John McDonnell has heightened the language used by saying the victims were "murdered by political decisions that were taken over recent decades". The shadow chancellor attacked those who viewed housing in terms of "financial speculation rather than for meeting a basic human need" and said closing fire stations had "contributed" to deaths.\n\nAt least 79 people are believed to have died in the fire in west London, which began in the early hours of 14 June.\n\nCladding - thought to have contributed to the spread of flames at Grenfell Tower - continues to be tested at 600 high-rise buildings across England. On Sunday, the government said cladding on 60 buildings in 25 local authority areas had failed safety tests. No sample had yet passed, it added.\n\nClashes in London over man's death\n\nProtesters have faced off with police in London in a demonstration over a man's death six days after being stopped in traffic by police. Campaigners say Edir Frederico Da Costa, 25, was "brutally beaten" by officers earlier this month. Bricks were thrown and fires lit in demonstrations outside Stratford bus station and Forest Gate police station. Six police officers were injured and four people were arrested. The Independent Police Complaints Commission is investigating the treatment of Mr Da Costa.\n\nGet news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning\n\nBoy, 16, charged with rape of eight-year-old girl\n\nA 16-year-old boy will appear at youth court later, charged with raping an eight-year-old girl girl in Manchester. Police were called to Nuthurst Park, in Moston on Saturday evening and a boy was arrested in a nearby shop. The girl is receiving support from specially trained officers.\n\nEd Sheeran closes Glastonbury\n\nSix years ago, he was playing to an audience of about 500 at one of Glastonbury's smallest venues, but Ed Sheeran - now somewhat more advanced in his career - closed this year's festival in front of 80,000 music fans. The Suffolk-raised star got the crowd singing along, saying it was his aim "to lose our voices". They'll get plenty of time to recover, as there's no Glastonbury next year. Cows living at the venue - Worthy Farm - will also probably enjoy the peace, says the BBC's Mark Savage.\n\nAnalysis: How Harry Potter enchanted the world\n\nBy Tim Masters, entertainment correspondent\n\nOkay, so books were around for a long time before Harry Potter. But JK Rowling turned book consumption, especially for children, into something close to addiction.\n\nRead Tim's full article\n\nWhat the papers say\n\nThe Grenfell Tower fire features on several front pages. The Daily Mail criticises Labour's John McDonnell for his comment that the victims had been "murdered by political decisions", accusing the shadow chancellor of "exploiting" the situation, while the i focuses on the "100%" failure rate of high-rise buildings tested for cladding safety so far. Metro quotes Glastonbury founder Michael Eavis as saying that Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told him he would be prime minister within six months.

He chills on Sunday.\n\n2) Karma Police\n\nImage copyright Daniel J Singer\n\nThere might have been extra security at Glastonbury this year, but the police weren't about to let that dampen the spirits.\n\nIf anything, the boys and girls in blue were determined to keep the Glastonbury spirit alive and kicking.\n\nThere was also this business with the mounted police and a false horse's head. The stuff of nightmares.\n\nImage copyright Glasto Police / Twitter\n\nImage copyright Glasto Police / Twitter\n\n3) It was sunny... Perhaps too sunny\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nOn Wednesday, as temperatures reached 34C, we sat on the hill opposite the Park Stage when, all of a sudden, everyone broke into a spontaneous round of applause. Five minutes later, it happened again. And again.\n\nIt took us about half an hour to work out that, every time, they were celebrating the sun disappearing behind a cloud.\n\n4) Dua Lipa broke herself\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Dua Lipa sings an acoustic version of Lost in Your Light at Glastonbury 2017.\n\n"I've done myself an injury," said Dua Lipa, as she limped into the BBC compound after a performance at the John Peel stage that was as packed with hits as it was people.\n\n"I've mashed my tailbone," she grimaced. "It was already bruised after I fell off a jet ski. Then I went on stage and danced like I'd never danced before. All sorts of crazy stuff. Now I can barely walk."\n\nGet well soon, Dua!\n\n5) Don't let dreadlocks drag you down\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Dreadlock holiday\n\nOne reveller had a very creative solution to their bad hair day.\n\n6) The Foo Fighters settled an old score with David Beckham\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Foo Fighters perform Everlong at Glastonbury 2017\n\nIn 1998, when the Foo Fighters played their first ever Glastonbury, half of the audience walked away to watch England v Columbia in the World Cup - a match where David Beckham scored one of two winning goals.\n\nFast forward 19 years, and the band headline the Pyramid Stage with Beckham watching from the sidelines.\n\nThat makes the score 1-1. But what happens next?\n\n7) It was the starriest Glastonbury ever\n\nImage copyright EPA\n\nIt wasn't just Beckham watching from the sidelines. We spotted Johnny Depp, Brad Pitt and Game of Thrones star Kit Harrington hanging out at the festival.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nWe also spotted Margot Robbie, Cara Delevingne and off-duty musicians Chris Martin and Rita Ora who, judging by her Instagram, arrived in a helicopter.\n\nImage copyright Rita Ora / Instagram\n\nMost surprising of all was Bradley Cooper - who turned up on the Pyramid Stage and played guitar (albeit silently) while filming a sequence for the upcoming remake of A Star Is Born.\n\nHe then introduced a set by country singer Kris Kristoffersen, who starred in the 1976 version of the film alongside Barbra Streisand.\n\nImage copyright Sarah Jeynes Image caption The star last visited Glastonbury as a guest of Metallica in 2014\n\n8) It's hard to concentrate on your delicate piano ballad when Jools Holland strikes up his big band\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Sigrid shares her vocal warm-up secrets\n\nWe had the privilege of watching up-and-coming pop star Sigrid soundcheck for a live session on BBC Radio 1. As you can see above, her acoustic rendition of Don't Kill My Vibe was nothing short of stunning.\n\nUnfortunately, when it came to the broadcast, the Norwegian was interrupted by Jools Holland and his Big Band, who launched into a thunderous set on the nearby Pyramid Stage.\n\nSigrid persevered; eyes screwed tight, delivering a delicate and heartfelt performance against the boogie woogie barrage.\n\n"That was weird," she told us afterwards. "I could hear the whole show behind me. I really had to concentrate. Thank goodness I had headphones!"\n\n9) Ohhhhh, Jeremy Corbyn\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The Labour leader was introduced on stage by Glastonbury Festival founder Michael Eavis\n\nEverywhere you went, the chant broke out: "Ohhhh, Jeremy Corbyn." We heard it between bands, we heard it in the healing field, we even heard it at the silent disco.\n\nBut most of all, we heard it during his appearance on the Pyramid Stage. The Labour leader delivered a well-received speech - but he forgot the one thing he was supposed to do: Introduce US hip-hop band Run The Jewels onto the stage.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC afterwards, they didn't seem to mind.\n\n"He said a lot of things that resonated with the common man," said Killer Mike. "I was very impressed. Old G can talk."\n\n10) Katy Perry doesn't know the Scottish flag\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Katy Perry performs Roar at Glastonbury 2017\n\n"I can see all of you!" shouted Katy Perry to the hordes who came to see her at the Pyramid Stage. "Even that security guard in the neon, way in the back by that blue flag with the X."\n\nThat would be the Saltire, Katy. The flag of Scotland.\n\nMind you, how many of you know the flag of Katy's home state, California? (It's got a grizzly bear on it, FYI).\n\n11) You don't have to spend a fortune on instruments to play Glastonbury\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Vegetable orchestra plays Glastonbury\n\nDave Grohl's signature DG-335 Gibson guitar will set you back about £4,500 - but you can play Glastonbury after a visit to your grocer, as we discovered when we met Finnish musician Vicky O'Neon.\n\n12) Stormzy had the time of his life\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Stormzy performs Big For Your Boots at Glastonbury 2017\n\n"Hey, mumzy, look at your boy now," beamed Stormzy, as he surveyed the massive crowd who turned up for his set on The Other Stage.\n\nThey included one Katherine Perry, who told the rapper she had "delayed the helicopter" to catch his set.\n\n"[I'm] just a massive fan," she added on Snapchat.\n\nImage copyright Twitter\n\nAfter posing for photographs with the star backstage, Stormzy took to Twitter to express his disbelief at how the whole night went down.\n\n"So happy right now, thank you to every single person that came and saw me," he wrote.\n\n"Chris Martin came to speak to me after. What an inspiration. And Katy Perry came as well! What a dream. We thank God."\n\nThen, apropos of nothing, he added, "Before I forget, Dynamo is the greatest magician on the planet."\n\nWhatever you say, Stormzy.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

Mrs Foster has been engaged in heated talks with the Prime Minister for two weeks on a confidence and supply deal to prop up the Conservatives' minority Government after Mrs May lost her majority at the recent general election. The Democratic Unionist Party leader told Sky News she was confident her party, which has 10 MPs, would clinch agreements in Westminster and Stormont. She said: "We're back in London again and my hope is that we will be able to finalise the deal between ourselves and the Conservative Party.\n\nGETTY Arlene Foster was in high spirits outside Downing Street this morning\n\n"As the Prime Minister herself has said, the deal will be public.

On the issue of how any deal would impact on the powersharing agreement between the province and southern Ireland, she said:"I think that this agreement will bring the prospects of doing a deal at Stormont closer because this will have a positive impact in relation to Northern Ireland.

It keeps the DUP at the centre of the story but to what end?” The Tory-DUP deal reportedly rests on an economic package for Northern Ireland which includes an increased capital spending on health and education, the newspaper added.

Actor Ravi Teja skipped the funeral of his brother Bharath Raj, who died in a car accident. Mass Maharaja's absence came as a big surprise for many in Telugu film industry.\n\nThe accident occurred when Bharath Raj was returning from Shamshabad to Gachibowli. The 45-year-old actor was driving his red Skoda sedan, which rammed into a truck parked outside Chennamma Hotel near Kotwalguda. He died on the spot and the police moved his body to the Osmania General Hospital mortuary. His brother Raghu and friend Uttej rushed to the hospital upon hearing the news.\n\nBharath Raj was a bachelor. He was staying alone at a flat in Madhapur. His mortal remains were directly taken to Jubilee Hills Mahaprasthanam on Sunday for the last rites. Actor Uttej was seen taking care of the arrangements for his funeral. Except for Raghu, none from his family were present at his cremation.\n\nThe last rites of Bharath Raj were performed in haste and actors Raghu Babu, Ali, Jeevitha, a few other celebs from the film industry and close friends attended the funeral. Ravi Teja, who stays in Filmnagar, neither came to see his body nor attended the funeral. Many were surprised by his absence.\n\nIt is said that Ravi Teja and his family were shocked at the sudden death of Bharath and found it difficult to come to terms with the tragedy. The family didn't want to see his battered body. "He can't control himself if he sees his brother's body that is battered beyond recognition. Hence, he didn't come," Ravi Teja's staff told Great Andhra.\n\nBut some people in the film industry have a different view on the family's absence. Bharat Raj was arrested a couple of times on charges of drug dealing and misbehaviour. His alcoholism had caused troubles for the family. Though Ravi Teja used to give him money every month, he had been keeping a distance from his brother for a long time.\n\nA character artist, Bharat Raj worked in Telugu films like Ready, Aa Mugguru, Jump Jilani, Rama Rama Krishna Krishna, Okkade, Athade Oka Sainyam, Peda Babu and Dochai.	2017-06-26 11:43:32.802153+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	21	899	['Shekhar H Hooli']

After some late Friday night showers Saturday started off a little overcast. But grey clouds and a light breeze did little to dampen the festival spirit. After all, can you really experience Glastonbury without the odd spot of rain? I think not.\n\nRain ponchos might have been out in force but The Bootleg Beatles with the Pepperland Sinfonia did a sterling job of lifting the early morning Pyramid crowd - 'All You Need is Love' providing a perfect karaoke start to the day.\n\nLater, on the Other Stage, British Sea Power’s lush melodies helped blow away the rest of the previous night’s cobwebs under a light drizzle, while a huge mass of the infamous Glastonbury seagulls circled overhead.\n\nBut Pilton is always the place to discover new acts on the smaller stages tucked around the site. It’s as much about new acts as established artists bussed in on huge coaches. Take a bow then, Stay Hungry - two young brothers (18 and 21) from Bristol.\n\nTheir upbeat, infectious rhymes and polished performance on the Croissant Neuf Bandstand put some of the acts on the bigger stages to shame. Incredibly they are unsigned - but I doubt they will be for much longer.\n\nWhile Thundercat’s mind-bending jazz bass noodlings divided the crowd on the West Holts stage, across the site in the Kidz Field, Dynamo brought together young and old. His child-friendly tricks sprinkled a bit of magic on the fields of Avalon. And he stayed behind posing for selfies with anyone who asked to.\n\nJeremy Corbyn gives a speech at Glastonbury Festival\n\nRespect also to the amazing juggling skills and audience banter from Andy Snatch who delighted the late afternoon crowds in the Theatre Fields with his slackline skills and flaming club prowess.\n\nKaty Perry’s perfect pop was the ideal teatime Pyramid slot, her massed ranks of flower dancers, confetti cannon and stage diving end to her set sending everyone out for the rest of evening on a suitably glammed up high. But despite her amazing stage show, it was one man on an empty stage who seemed to get the best reception of the day.\n\nJeremy Corbyn’s stirring, passionate speech promising a “world of real opportunity for everyone”, striking a real chord and resulting in mass chanting of his name.\n\nAway from the headliners, Arcadia was the place to be at midnight for the incredible Metamorphosis show. It’s impossible not to be blown away by the sight of a 50-tonne giant metallic spider shooting 60ft jets of flame into the sky while other spider-like creatures crawled above on high wires, other alien beings seemingly conducting lighting while giant eggs hatched.\n\nA simply stunning end to an ideal day.	2017-06-26 11:41:24.951393+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	26	795	['David Taylor']

Liverpool must pay double what they paid for Mohamed Salah if they are to sign Naby Keita from RB Leipzig this summer, as Jurgen Klopp looks to push ahead for the second of his seven summer transfers.\n\nSalah signed for £34.3m last week and Klopp is already moving onto his next target, after the Guinean’s fine debut season with Leipzig.\n\nThe Bundesliga runners-up have been quoted as wanting £70m for the midfielder, who Klopp wants to add more energy and dynamism to his midfield, given the extra games the Reds will be playing in the Champions League next season.\n\nHow could Liverpool line up next season?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13 show all How could Liverpool line up next season?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1/13 How could Liverpool line up at the beginning of the new season? Getty Images\n\n2/13 GK: Simon Mignolet Liverpool were linked with Joe Hart for much of last season, but in April Jurgen Klopp ruled out signing the England international by insisting he was happy with his current goalkeeping options. “There was never any doubt that Simon is a top keeper,” the German said of Mignolet recently. West Ham United via Getty Images\n\n3/13 RB: Nathanial Clyne A first-team regular for the last two seasons now. Could arguably do better when in advanced positions and when Liverpool are chasing a game, but Klopp is unlikely to sign another right-back considering there are other areas of the team that need strengthening first. Liverpool FC via Getty Images\n\n4/13 CB: Ben Gibson After pulling out of the deal to sign Virgil van Dijk from Southampton, the Reds have turned their attention to Ben Gibson, who is almost certain to leave Middlesbrough after their relegation. Boro want around £20m after his England call up but Liverpool are confident they can beat Tottenham to his signing. Getty Images\n\n5/13 CB: Joel Matip Has been a success since signing from Schalke on a free transfer at the beginning of last season. With a season of Premier League football now under his belt, he’s guaranteed to get even better next season. Liverpool FC via Getty Images\n\n6/13 LB: Benjamin Mendy L'Equipe reported on Saturday that Liverpool were now in pole position to sign Mendy from Monaco after overtaking Manchester City in negotiations. The left-back is rating at £40m and would become Liverpool's most expensive ever player, but they need someone to replace James Milner in that position. Getty Images\n\n7/13 LM: Dusan Tadic Liverpool are targeting yet another Southampton star but they are aware they can claim Tadic on the cheap as he has a reported £13m release clause - something he has refused to deny. He would jostle for position with Adam Lallana and Philippe Coutinho given the extra games the Reds will need to play with their Champions League return. Getty\n\n8/13 CM: Naby Keita The 29-year-old signed a new £25m four-year contract in February, with Klopp telling journalists that Lallana was “a very important player for us – a player I trust in the dressing room.” He enjoyed a fine 2016/17 season and has developed into one of the club’s most important players. Jordan Henderson is Liverpool’s club captain, but after two injury-plagued seasons, the rumour is that Klopp could look to replace him with RB Leipzig’s box to box midfielder Keita. The Guinea international has been a revelation in the Bundesliga this season and knows where the goal is despite playing as a defensive midfielder, having scored 8 league goals last term. Bongarts/Getty Images\n\n9/13 RM: Philippe Coutinho The Brazilian was not at his best last season, but is still one of the Premier League’s most talented players when he is in-form and injury free. Getty Images\n\n10/13 LW: Sadio Mane One of the signings of the season last year, and Liverpool’s form nose-dived alarmingly when he picked up his season-ending injury against Everton. Scored 13 goals in the league for Liverpool and was named the Players’ Player and Fans Player at the end of season awards. Liverpool FC via Getty Images\n\n11/13 RW: Mohamed Salah Liverpool would have some truly frightening pace at their disposal if they lined up with Mane on one flank and ex-Chelsea winger Salah on the other. The Egyptian wasn’t given a fair crack of things at Chelsea but is still only 24-years-old and was one of Roma’s best players last season, scoring 19 goals over the season. Getty Images\n\n12/13 CF: Timo Werner The 21-year-old made his full German debut in the friendly against England in March and is regarded as one of Europe’s most exciting young strikers, having scored 21 goals in the Bundesliga for Leipzig last season. “If you were to play at Anfield and hear the fans sing ‘You’ll Never Walk Alone,’ it would certainly be something special,” Werner told Sport Bild earlier this season. Bongarts/Getty Images\n\n13/13 CF: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang Liverpool initially targeted Timo Werner but have been frustrated in their attempts to sign the young German striker. Le Parisien have reported that the club may now turn their attention towards Aubameyang. They have claimed that Liverpool's US owners Fenway Sports Group are prepared to spend a club record £60m to land their man. Getty\n\nLeipzig were the surprise package in Germany last year as they themselves qualified for the Champions League for the first time in their history, leading to a number of their high-profile players trying to be poached by other European clubs.\n\nLiverpool have been interested in Keita, who has won frequent comparisons to N’Golo Kante, all summer but according to German sports daily Bild, they must pay up to £70m for his services.\n\nIt comes only days after Leipzig’s CEO Oliver Mintzlaff insisted they would not be selling any of their stars this summer, including another Liverpool target Emil Forsberg, and insisted it would be “negligent” to do so.\n\n“It would be negligent to sell one of our key players now,” he said last week.\n\n“Emil and Naby are extremely talented and developing players. We are glad that we are able to keep up with their development as a club.\n\n“And now we can prove ourselves in the Champions League in the coming season.”\n\nAs well as Keita, Klopp is also understood to be keen on Arsenal’s Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, with the Gunners needing to sell this summer to keep their wage budget within Premier League rules if they are to keep Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez.\n\nLiverpool are also keeping tabs on Keita’s Leipzig teammate Timo Werner, after his goals fired the east German side into a second-place finish behind Bayern Munich.\n\nLiverpool summer transfer targets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10 show all Liverpool summer transfer targets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1/10 Mohamed Salah The Salah deal is inching over the line, with Liverpool confident of completing the deal by the end of the month. Roma are equally keen to sell given their need to comply with Fifa Financial Fair Play regulations. The winger will add yet more pace and industry to Liverpool's attack. Getty Images\n\n2/10 Timo Werner Werner scored 21 goals in the Bundesliga last season as his goals fired RB Leipzig to second place and a first-ever Champions League qualification. The German club are keen to keep him but money talks and Liverpool are desperate for an out-and-out goalscorer. Bongarts/Getty Images\n\n3/10 Naby Keita A difficult signing to pull off, but one that Liverpool are interested in making. Keita's dynamic performances in the centre of RB Leipzig's midfield have caught Klopp's eye, but also the attention of Bayern Munich, who are also monitoring the player.\n\n4/10 Dusan Tadic The Southampton attacker is out of favour on the south coast and desperate for a way out of the club. Liverpool are interested in him to provide competition and back-up to the likes of Philippe Coutinho and Adam Lallana with the added strain of European football.\n\n5/10 Andrew Robertson Given Hull's relegation to the Championship, Robertson is one of the players in the shop window. Left-backs are at the forefront of Klopp's transfer activity and Robertson will come fairly cheap. Getty Images\n\n6/10 Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain Somewhat surprising reports have arisen over recent weeks that Chamberlain will be a Liverpool player next season. A disappointing season for Arsenal has left their squad in disarray, and it is thought that the 23 year-old midfielder is seeking a new challenge. The player’s versatility across midfield positions is an appealing to Klopp, who will need added squad depth. Arsenal will not be keen to sell to a rival, but if the rumours are to be believed, Chamberlain has his heart set on the Merseyside club and a £35 million transfer could well be on the cards.\n\n7/10 Douglas Costa The 26 year old Brazilian winger has gained plaudits for his performances at the German champions, yet the player stated earlier in the season that he is ‘not that happy’, presumably at missing out to Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben regularly. He would cost upwards of £25 million and have plenty of suitors, meaning Liverpool are simply one of many clubs he could choose from, although he did recently ‘like’ a tweet from a Liverpool fan about the possibility of him joining the club. There is also a chance that Costa is happy in Munich but is seeking an improved deal, which would come as no real surprise.\n\n8/10 Ryan Sessegnon Sessegnon is a long-term option at left-back for Liverpool with the 17-year-old lighting up the Championship with Fulham. With only Alberto Moreno, who is expected to leave, and James Milner available in that position, Klopp wants to bring in at least two. He faces competition from Manchester United and Tottenham though.\n\n9/10 Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang The most speculative target on the list is Gabon forward Aubameyang, who became a household name under Jurgen Klopp at Dortmund. Constant questions over his future are expected to culminate in a move this summer, and while his former boss will no doubt be interested, European giants Real Madrid are circling and thought to be his preferred destination. While the versatile Roberto Firmino has had a good season deployed as Liverpool’s first choice striker and Divock Origi a promising talent, they still lack a world class centre forward like Aubameyang. Dortmund CEO Hanz-Joachim Watzke stated earlier this year that the striker, who has three years to run on his contract, would only leave ‘for an outrageous fee’.\n\n10/10 Jonas Hector A player Klopp will know well, the 26 year-old is thought to be a serious option with the manager unconvinced by Alberto Moreno. James Milner has deputised brilliantly this season but an out-and-out left back is a priority for the summer. Hector has earned 27 caps for Germany since 2014 and is known for his excellent positional understanding and for putting in accurate crosses. It is thought he would cost in excess of £20 million, which could be well worth it for a good player approaching his prime years.\n\nOnly three strikers scored more times than Werner’s 21 strikes over the course of the Bundesliga season and the Reds want a natural goalscorer to help deal with Champions League football.\n\nChelsea’s Dominic Solanke is already set to arrive at the end of his contract on July 1st, while Hull's Andrew Robertson is an option at left-back given James Milner had been forced to play there throughout this season.	2017-06-26 11:41:26.912679+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	26	796	['Jack Austin']

And again.\n\nIt took us about half an hour to work out that, every time, they were celebrating the sun disappearing behind a cloud.\n\n4) Dua Lipa broke herself\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Dua Lipa sings an acoustic version of Lost in Your Light at Glastonbury 2017.\n\n"I've done myself an injury," said Dua Lipa, as she limped into the BBC compound after a performance at the John Peel stage that was as packed with hits as it was people.\n\n"I've mashed my tailbone," she grimaced. "It was already bruised after I fell off a jet ski. Then I went on stage and danced like I'd never danced before. All sorts of crazy stuff. Now I can barely walk."\n\nGet well soon, Dua!\n\n5) Don't let dreadlocks drag you down\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Dreadlock holiday\n\nOne reveller had a very creative solution to their bad hair day.\n\n6) The Foo Fighters settled an old score with David Beckham\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Foo Fighters perform Everlong at Glastonbury 2017\n\nIn 1998, when the Foo Fighters played their first ever Glastonbury, half of the audience walked away to watch England v Columbia in the World Cup - a match where David Beckham scored one of two winning goals.\n\nFast forward 19 years, and the band headline the Pyramid Stage with Beckham watching from the sidelines.\n\nThat makes the score 1-1. But what happens next?\n\n7) It was the starriest Glastonbury ever\n\nImage copyright EPA\n\nIt wasn't just Beckham watching from the sidelines. We spotted Johnny Depp, Brad Pitt and Game of Thrones star Kit Harrington hanging out at the festival.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nWe also spotted Margot Robbie, Cara Delevingne and off-duty musicians Chris Martin and Rita Ora who, judging by her Instagram, arrived in a helicopter.\n\nImage copyright Rita Ora / Instagram\n\nMost surprising of all was Bradley Cooper - who turned up on the Pyramid Stage and played guitar (albeit silently) while filming a sequence for the upcoming remake of A Star Is Born.\n\nHe then introduced a set by country singer Kris Kristoffersen, who starred in the 1976 version of the film alongside Barbra Streisand.\n\nImage copyright Sarah Jeynes Image caption The star last visited Glastonbury as a guest of Metallica in 2014\n\n8) It's hard to concentrate on your delicate piano ballad when Jools Holland strikes up his big band\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Sigrid shares her vocal warm-up secrets\n\nWe had the privilege of watching up-and-coming pop star Sigrid soundcheck for a live session on BBC Radio 1. As you can see above, her acoustic rendition of Don't Kill My Vibe was nothing short of stunning.\n\nUnfortunately, when it came to the broadcast, the Norwegian was interrupted by Jools Holland and his Big Band, who launched into a thunderous set on the nearby Pyramid Stage.\n\nSigrid persevered; eyes screwed tight, delivering a delicate and heartfelt performance against the boogie woogie barrage.\n\n"That was weird," she told us afterwards. "I could hear the whole show behind me. I really had to concentrate. Thank goodness I had headphones!"\n\n9) Ohhhhh, Jeremy Corbyn\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The Labour leader was introduced on stage by Glastonbury Festival founder Michael Eavis\n\nEverywhere you went, the chant broke out: "Ohhhh, Jeremy Corbyn." We heard it between bands, we heard it in the healing field, we even heard it at the silent disco.\n\nBut most of all, we heard it during his appearance on the Pyramid Stage. The Labour leader delivered a well-received speech - but he forgot the one thing he was supposed to do: Introduce US hip-hop band Run The Jewels onto the stage.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC afterwards, they didn't seem to mind.\n\n"He said a lot of things that resonated with the common man," said Killer Mike. "I was very impressed. Old G can talk."\n\n10) Katy Perry doesn't know the Scottish flag\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Katy Perry performs Roar at Glastonbury 2017\n\n"I can see all of you!" shouted Katy Perry to the hordes who came to see her at the Pyramid Stage. "Even that security guard in the neon, way in the back by that blue flag with the X."\n\nThat would be the Saltire, Katy. The flag of Scotland.\n\nMind you, how many of you know the flag of Katy's home state, California?

What an inspiration. And Katy Perry came as well! What a dream. We thank God."\n\nThen, apropos of nothing, he added, "Before I forget, Dynamo is the greatest magician on the planet."\n\nWhatever you say, Stormzy.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

Attention to detail and clever use of colour have helped Viki and Mike Lander turn their house, in Wandsworth’s exclusive Spencer Park, into something rather special.\n\n\n\nIt’s unusual to walk into a London home and come face to face with a sparkling aquarium wall full of glistening exotic fish. But it’s even more amazing that the fish match the bespoke, lacquered TV surround visible through the tank.\n\n\n\n“It’s not amazing really,” says Viki, “because I chose the fish to go with it.”\n\n\n\nVicki, 42, and her 50-year-old husband have completely remodelled the property, adding half as much space again.\n\n\n\nTAKE A LOOK AROUND THE REMODELLED PROPERTY:\n\nViki and Mike Lander’s showpiece home\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7 show all Viki and Mike Lander’s showpiece home\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1/7 ​Boutique bathroom Sleek, minimalist styling - enhanced by quirky modern pendant lighting.\n\n2/7 Bespoke feature wallpapers A photographic paper brightens up a bedroom.\n\n3/7 ​​Clever storage Bedroom space is put to practical use, while doors in bold teal make a style statement.\n\n4/7 Easy on the eye Strong colours make the perfect foil for soft neutrals.\n\n5/7 Colour accents Right down to the coffee maker, everything in this home has been considered, particularly for colour.\n\n6/7 Staying in shape The basement houses the Landers' home gym and a generous playroom for their young son, Leo.\n\n7/7 Hidden depths As the house was set on a deep concrete slab, a 16ft basement was carved out beneath the garden, which itself is a generous size and now features an impressive deck and a lawn.\n\n\n\n\n\n“People use so much white because they’re afraid of going wrong,” says Viki, “but a home needs colour.”\n\n\n\nAs if to demonstrate that fact, sharp lime green Ligne Roset Pop chairs in the sitting area seem to match the spring grass outside.\n\n\n\nYou could say that Viki and Mike matched themselves, too. In 2006, Viki, who was running her own graphic design agency while doing up her home as a sideline, was bored with being single. So her brother said that if she would roast a chicken, over supper he would post online dating profiles for Viki as well as himself.\n\n\n\nA home needs colour: lime green chairs echo the spring grass in the garden\n\n\n\nNot long after that, Viki arranged to meet Mike. “We were inseparable from that moment. My friends all said, ‘He’s the one’,” she says. The new couple owned their flats in Chiswick and Clapham, but a year after getting married in 2007, they bought a house in Clapham Common that had been hacked into five bedsits, and set about turning it back into a single home.\n\n\n\nMike, who had a consultancy business, loved doing this as much as Viki. The couple had already completed six refurbishments between them, so they hatched the idea of turning their passion into a joint career. Viki would handle design and Mike, with his project management background, the process. But when should they make the leap? Life is always about timing, and their son Leo’s birth at the end of 2012 was the turning point.\n\n\n\nThey wanted a property to turn into a family home, with a generous garden as a priority. In early summer 2013 they saw a plain-looking Seventies townhouse advertised by Knight Frank.\n\n\n\n“Within 72 hours we bought it,” says Viki. “I’d already designed a basement while we were viewing.” Desirable Spencer Park is surrounded by a big loop of grand Victorian houses. In 1972, a speculator demolished one mansion and replaced it with a terrace of four modern houses, one of which the Landers bought.\n\n\n\n“It was hideous,” says Viki. “There was a tired white kitchen, nonsensical room divisions, a stupid staircase stuck in the middle and a plastic extension on the back, complete with plastic windows, that the neighbours called the Taj Mahal.\n\n\n\n“The garden was a thicket of overgrown climbers and rotten decking.”\n\n\n\nSince the house was set on a deep concrete slab, Viki had the bold idea of carving out a 16ft-deep basement under the garden to make a playroom for Leo and a top-of-the range gym for her and Mike. “Everyone said that was mad,” she says.\n\n\n\nThey sailed through planning without a hitch, broke ground in March last year, and finished just nine months later, moving in two days before Christmas.\n\n\n\nThe den: friends thought the couple were “mad” to have a 16ft basement carved out of the garden but it created space for a gym for Viki and Mike and a playroom (above) for their son, Leo\n\n\n\nThat sort of excavation comes at a price, of course — not to mention 250 skips full of rock and subsoil that thundered relentlessly out of the front door on a conveyor belt. The family sensibly decamped to a rented flat.\n\n\n\nOn the ground floor the house has been opened up and the staircase shifted to one side, making a huge, bright living space, with the former garage turned into an office for the couple’s new design business. This sleek space flows through to the garden, which has an impressive light oak deck that turns out to be a modern composite — no splinters for tiny feet — and three big Portuguese pom pom laurels.\n\n\n\nRight down to the coffee maker, everything in this home has been considered, particularly for colour. Against the grey wool carpet and soft Little Greene Limestone paint that runs throughout, Viki has used strong, contemporary colours, but these are softened by the luxurious, heavy, shot silk curtains in the bedrooms, and interesting bespoke feature wallpapers.\n\n\n\nIn the third bedroom, for example, the wall the bed sits against is covered in a photographic paper of vivid birds perching on the boughs of trees.\n\n\n\nIn the couple’s own large en suite bathroom, the floor is patinated block parquet — a surprise against the imitation marble ceramic tiles, but it works well, and adds a hint of Versailles ballroom to the overall boutique look.\n\n\n\nWhat is particularly nice about this house is that this Seventies building, which once seemed a fish out of water in such a historic area, now has the right interior to help it stand out.\n\n\n\nWHAT IT COST\n\nHouse in 2013: £2.05 million\n\nMoney spent (if all fees had been included): £1.49 million\n\nValue now: £4 million (estimate)\n\n\n\nGET THE LOOK	2017-06-26 23:44:06.34771+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	20	1247	['Philippa Stockley']

GETTY JIVE TALKIN: Barry Gibb had the entire Glastonbury festival singing along\n\nThe Bee Gees star had the entire festival singing along to helium-voiced hits like How Deep Is Your Love? yesterday afternoon during the event's hallowed legends slot. After battling years of criticism Barry is enjoying the love and positivity his falsetto vocals now conjure up. He told me: "I can't believe it - everyone is doing it now and Sam Smith is a perfect example, it's great. "But I was just playing catch up with Prince. The amount of falsetto he was using was outrageous.\n\nGlastonbury 2017: Brits flash flesh in most outrageous festival ever Once a year, seemingly normal people dress up in nonsensical costumes and flock to a field in Wiltshire to get drunk, listen to the best music of the day and let it all hang out 1 / 29 Getty Images Rachel Rousham from the White Ribbon Alliance joins members of the Avalonian Choir for a pro-feminist event\n\n“I can't believe it - everyone is doing it now and Sam Smith is a perfect example, it's great” Barry Gibb "I would always get criticised for singing high but he used to get away with it." Barry was back at Glasto a year after joining Coldplay on stage for a version of Staying Alive. Naturally people still associate Barry with his late brothers, as does he, something he wrote about on his recent solo album, In The Now. He explained: "I touched on the idea that I can still see my brothers, even on stage, I can smell their breath around the microphone because we were so used to all singing around the same microphone."\n\nBarry's band included younger family members and he'd love them to join forces as a 'Bee Gees Part 2' one day. He explained: "Nina my granddaughter is a great dancer. "Travis - who is my third son - is into techno rock and a great DJ. Sammy - Maurice's daughter is a really fine singer. "But I've yet to see that commitment in her that means everything. "It meant everything to us as the Bee Gees, everything else was secondary to being in a pop group." The past may haunt him, but performing for Barry is anything but a Tragedy. He added: "Now it's more about me as an individual seizing life." -----------------------------------------------\n\nGETTY GLASTO: Ed Sheeran said last night's headline set was his first and last\n\nEd in band tease Last night's headline set by Ed Sheeran was his first - and last. The chart-topping tunesmith reckons the only way he'll do another one is if he needs the cash. Ed said: "You never know, if I get a bad tax bill when I'm 50 I may get back on the road but I don't expect to be touring then." Last night was a masterclass in performing solo but Ed reckons that could change. He said: "I think there's only so far a loop pedal can take you before you've done everything with it. I'll evolve I guess." -----------------------------------------------\n\nOasis of calm The Gallagher brothers were still Half A World Away at Glasto. Liam rocked the night away with Grime stars like Wiley after his impressive live set on Saturday night. Meanwhile, estranged brother Noel kept well away and rocked out with Metallica's Lars Ulrich at the Pyramid Stage VIP area. He was on good form, handing out beers to Glasto staff at 5am Sunday morning! Liam said earlier: "I'm down with the grime boys, I met Wiley and we had a chat about a fight that's coming up. I met Stormzy, I've heard it's the new punk." Liam explained why he performed Don't Look Back In Anger for the first time: "If our kid isn't going to do it for them then I'll do it for them." As you were boys. -----------------------------------------------\n\nGlasto CARNAGE! Boobs, booze and hippy crack Glasto's raunchy revellers are a thing of legend.

The Foo Fighters man was determined to beat the 33 f***s potty-mouthed Adele managed last year. "Now I love Adele, but guess what," said Dave before repeatedly chanting "f***" over and over again. "OK, I think we broke her record." Now Dave wants his eight year-old daughter to follow in his footsteps. Referring to Harper, who already plays drums on stage with Foos, he said: "Unfortunately the other Grohl drummer will not be making it to Glastonbury this year, but maybe she'll be headlining in 2030. "She's gutsy, and that's half the battle." 2030 it is then. -----------------------------------------------\n\nGETTY ROCKING: Biffy Clyro made sure everyone knew they still had cojones at Glasto\n\nBiffy get back to rocking Biffy Clyro made sure everyone knew they still had cojones at Glasto. The band experimented with pop on their recent album but it was rock and roll all the way last night. Simon Neil said: "It hurt when people shouted: 'Where's your balls gone?' Yes we hid our balls. "So yeah I think rock and roll is evolving, but to me there's something really expressive about standing on stage holding a guitar and screaming to the top of your lungs." -----------------------------------------------\n\nGLASTO 2017: Revellers arrive for five days of music and debauchery The highlight of the summer festivals is here, and revellers have are pouring through the gates ready for five days of debauchery, art and music 1 / 24 Getty Images Festival fans queue as the gates open at the Glastonbury Festival amid heightened security	2017-06-26 11:42:01.325981+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	12	811	['James Cabooter With Sam Mayers']

The beleaguered Co-operative Bank is closing in on a £700m rescue deal with US hedge funds amid ongoing talks about the separation of the vast pension scheme it shares with the Co-op Group.\n\nConfirming a report by Sky News, the Co-op Bank said on Monday morning that it was on the verge of finalising an agreement that would end months of uncertainty about its future.\n\nThe Bank also confirmed that it had terminated talks with a Qatari-Swiss consortium to focus on a rescue package provided by its existing bondholders, who also own most of its shares.\n\n"The Proposal, if implemented, would enable the Bank to meet the longer-term‎ capital requirements applicable to all UK banks and to continue as a standalone entity," it said in a statement to the stock exchange.\n\n"The proposal would also safeguard the Bank's values and ethics."\n\nThe latest development follows a weekend of talks between the hedge funds and trustees of the £10bn Pace retirement plan, which manages the retirement savings of nearly 90,000 Co-op Group and Bank workers.\n\nThe trustees have been insisting that Co-op Bank bondholders commit to funding a newly sectionalised Bank pension scheme over a multi-year period.\n\nIt is understood that the Co-op Group - the Bank's former sole shareholder - has ruled out providing new funds to the joint pension scheme to help terminate the long-standing reciprocal guarantee deal between them.\n\nHowever, the Bank said it was also at an "advanced" stage of talks about the Pace separation.\n\nSignificantly, the Co-op Bank also said it had been informed by banking regulators at the weekend that its long-term capital requirements would be lower than previously expected.\n\nIt added that it saw the potential to pay a dividend to shareholders in 2021 if its business plan was delivered over the coming years.\n\nMonday's statement will raise hopes that a deal to save the Co-op Bank - and avoid it becoming a test-case for the Bank of England's powers to wind down failing lenders - can be struck well before a September deadline for repayment of a £400m bond.\n\nThe trustees have been seeking a deal under which the Co-op Bank bondholders commit to funding its pension scheme on a low-risk basis over an unspecified period.\n\nThe bondholders have offered to inject £62.5m in cash over five years to eliminate an actuarial deficit, with the scheme gaining rights to Co-op Bank assets in the event of a future crisis.\n\nThe Co-op Group has expressed unhappiness with this plan, and has been resisting efforts from the hedge funds that it should make a financial contribution to end the "last man standing" arrangement between it and the Co-op Bank.\n\nThat deal means that each side commits to standing behind the other's pension liabilities if it fails.\n\nThe Co-op Group, which is one of the UK's biggest food retailers and funeral care providers, would see its stake in the Bank slashed to less than 5% under the bondholders' plan.\n\nUnder the current Pace agreement, the Group pays £20m into the scheme each year, with the Bank contributing £5m, reflecting their respective assets and liabilities.\n\nA new triennial valuation of the scheme deficit is due to take place this year.\n\nThe scramble to rescue the Co-op Bank has been triggered by its need to find more than £700m of new capital.\n\nThe US hedge funds - Blue Mountain Capital Management, Cyrus Capital Partners, GoldenTree Asset Management and Silver Point - are said to be willing to inject more than £240m of new equity into the lender.\n\nIn March, the Co-op Bank said it would require between £700m and £750m of new top quality capital, the majority of which would be generated by exchanging some of its debt for equity - a process known as a liability management exercise.\n\nThe remainder would come from issuing new shares.\n\nThe Co-op Bank has been hit by a string of legacy issues, as well as the challenge posed by ultra-low interest rates, since its £1.5bn bailout in 2013.\n\nThe lender announced an annual loss this year of £477m, taking its total losses since its rescue in 2013 to well over £2.5bn.\n\nThe Co-op Bank's balance sheet ballooned following a disastrous merger with the Britannia Building Society, and then ran into trouble when it tried to buy more than 600 branches from Lloyds Banking Group.\n\nIts former chairman, Paul Flowers, brought it into disrepute when his drug-taking and sexual proclivities were exposed by a tabloid newspaper, while his financial competence was questioned by MPs.	2017-06-26 11:42:17.242661+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	42	828	['Mark Kleinman', 'City Editor']

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Orla Guerin on the front line in Mosul\n\nFighters of so-called Islamic State (IS) have launched counter-attacks as they come under growing pressure from Iraqi forces in Mosul.\n\nIS deployed large numbers of suicide bombers in different parts of the northern Iraqi city but the affected areas were quickly brought under control, Iraqi officials say.\n\nIS has now been squeezed into a square mile of territory in Mosul's Old City.\n\nIt is the final phase of an Iraqi offensive to remove them from Mosul.\n\nIt is clear that these are the dying days of IS in Mosul, the BBC's Orla Guerin reports from the edge of the Old City where she is moving with Iraqi forces.\n\nThe jihadists blew up the city's landmark al-Nuri mosque last Wednesday. This has now given Iraqi forces a clear hand to move more swiftly against IS and they have certainly done so, our correspondent adds.\n\nThere were some 20 air strikes against the group on Sunday, and more overnight. Helicopter gunships pounded IS positions and extensive mortar fire was heard.\n\nAt least two IS counter-attacks were reported on Sunday night. The Baghdad-based Kurdish Shafaq news agency reported three attacks by the group in western Mosul - in Al-Tanak, Rajm Hadid and Al-Yarmouk districts.\n\nResidents' houses were set on fire, the agency said.\n\nEyewitness: Sally Becker, aid worker\n\nI was just a couple of streets away from one of the IS counter-attacks.\n\nWe had around 20 bodies (Iraqi soldiers) here yesterday and many more injured. In fact the trauma stabilisation point (TSP) is full of soldiers right now.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption What JK Rowling said about first Harry Potter book in 1997\n\nCan you believe it's 20 years since the publication of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone?\n\nJoanne Rowling, as she was known then, dreamed up the story of the bespectacled boy wizard on a train trip between London and Manchester.\n\nShe finished the manuscript in 1995, writing much of it in cafes in Edinburgh while her baby from her first marriage slept in a pram.\n\nAfter many rejections, the manuscript was eventually picked up by Bloomsbury. The first hardback print run, which came out on 26 June 1997, was just 500 copies.\n\nThen something magic happened. That first book - and the six that followed - went on to sell more than 450 million copies around the world.\n\nHere's a look at the many ways the Harry Potter phenomenon has cast a spell on the cultural landscape over two decades.\n\nIt got kids (and adults) reading\n\nImage caption The Potter books have sold more than 450 million copies\n\nOkay, so books were around for a long time before Harry Potter. But JK Rowling turned book consumption, especially for children, into something close to addiction.\n\nYou want proof? The UK release of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban in 1999 was timed at 3.45pm to prevent children in England and Wales from skipping school to get their copy.\n\nThe later books got HUGE but it didn't stop kids devouring them.\n\nGrown-ups got hooked too, with the books being released in adult-friendly covers.\n\nThe book releases themselves became headline news: when the fourth book Goblet of Fire came out in 2000, booksellers around the world got together to coordinate the first ever global midnight launch.\n\nWhen Rowling received an honorary degree at St Andrews University that same year, the Scottish institution said she had proved that children's books "are still capable of capturing and enchanting an immense audience, irrespective of the competing attractions of television, Nintendo, Gameboy and Pokemon".\n\nIt also got people writing\n\nImage copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption Harry Potter fans at the premiere of the final film, the Deathly Hallows Part 2\n\nThe Harry Potter books are credited with opening the way to a whole swathe load of young adult fantasy fiction.\n\nLots of books were released in the hope they would be "the next Harry Potter", such as Artemis Fowl, The Spiderwick Chronicles and A Series of Unfortunate Events.\n\nWould we have had blockbuster series like Twilight and The Hunger Games novels had not Potter paved the way?\n\nAnd let's not forget fan fiction.\n\nThe internet is thrumming with tens of thousands of unofficial spin-off stories about life at Hogwarts, The Dursleys and what the Weasley twins get up to at parties.\n\nA warning to the curious: some are NSFW.\n\nIt got us all steamed up about trains\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nFor a generation of kids brought up on Thomas the Tank Engine and The Polar Express, there was suddenly a shiny new steam train in the engine shed.\n\nYes, the Hogwarts Express.\n\nNo trip to King's Cross Station in London is complete without a selfie on Platform Nine and Three-Quarters.\n\nIt introduced new words to the dictionary\n\nImage copyright Royal Mail Image caption The Royal Mail produced special stamps based on the book covers\n\nMost words have to be around for 10 years before they will be considered for the Oxford English Dictionary, but JK Rowling's word "muggle" - which made its debut in Philosopher's Stone - was an exception.\n\nIt was added to the OED in less than half the usual time, appearing in 2002 as "a person who lacks a particular skill or skills, or who is regarded as inferior in some way".\n\nIn the world of Harry Potter, a muggle is a person without magical powers.\n\nWe suspect that Crumple-Horned Snorkack - an elusive magical creature in Sweden - may take longer to make it into the muggle lexicon.\n\nIt invented a new sport\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Watch Quidditch being played at the world cup\n\nIn the books, Quidditch is a magical sport played on flying broomsticks, and involves bludgers, quaffles and a golden snitch - a small ball with wings.\n\nIn the real world, Quidditch is a non-magical sport played on broomsticks, and involves bludgers, quaffles and a golden snitch - a person in a yellow t-shirt with a Velcro tail attached to their shorts.\n\nIt started in the US around 2005 and has become a global sport with its own governing body.

It's the eighth-highest grossing film of all time.\n\nThe franchise - now known as JK Rowling's Wizarding World - has continued with the spin-off Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (2016).\n\nAnd there's plenty more to come.

One wrote: "British theatre hasn't known anything like it for decades and I haven't seen anything directly comparable in all my reviewing days."\n\nThe play won a record-breaking nine prizes at this year's Olivier Awards.\n\nCursed Child will be opening on Broadway in New York in 2018 and JK Rowling has said she would like it to be seen widely around the world.\n\nIt's helped shape the millennial generation\n\nImage copyright Warner Bros/AP Image caption Is anyone worse than Voldemort?\n\nMillions of people reaching young adulthood have never known a world without Harry Potter.\n\nMany who've grown up with the books can now get regular doses of JK Rowling via social media - she's got an army of almost 11m followers.\n\nWhen Donald Trump was compared with Lord Voldemort last year, Rowling tweeted: "How horrible. Voldemort was nowhere near as bad."\n\nShe later mocked Twitter users who threatened to burn her books.\n\nOne response read: "Guess it's true what they say: you can lead a girl to books about the rise and fall of an autocrat, but you still can't make her think."\n\nTwenty years on from that first book, it looks like no-one's going to be saying "Avada Kedavra" to Harry Potter anytime soon.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

Attention to detail and clever use of colour have helped Viki and Mike Lander turn their house, in Wandsworth’s exclusive Spencer Park, into something rather special.\n\n\n\nIt’s unusual to walk into a London home and come face to face with a sparkling aquarium wall full of glistening exotic fish. But it’s even more amazing that the fish match the bespoke, lacquered TV surround visible through the tank.\n\n\n\n“It’s not amazing really,” says Viki, “because I chose the fish to go with it.”\n\n\n\nVicki, 42, and her 50-year-old husband have completely remodelled the property, adding half as much space again.\n\n\n\nTAKE A LOOK AROUND THE REMODELLED PROPERTY:\n\nViki and Mike Lander’s showpiece home\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7 show all Viki and Mike Lander’s showpiece home\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1/7 ​Boutique bathroom Sleek, minimalist styling - enhanced by quirky modern pendant lighting.\n\n2/7 Bespoke feature wallpapers A photographic paper brightens up a bedroom.\n\n3/7 ​​Clever storage Bedroom space is put to practical use, while doors in bold teal make a style statement.\n\n4/7 Easy on the eye Strong colours make the perfect foil for soft neutrals.\n\n5/7 Colour accents Right down to the coffee maker, everything in this home has been considered, particularly for colour.\n\n6/7 Staying in shape The basement houses the Landers' home gym and a generous playroom for their young son, Leo.\n\n7/7 Hidden depths As the house was set on a deep concrete slab, a 16ft basement was carved out beneath the garden, which itself is a generous size and now features an impressive deck and a lawn.\n\n\n\n\n\n“People use so much white because they’re afraid of going wrong,” says Viki, “but a home needs colour.”\n\n\n\nAs if to demonstrate that fact, sharp lime green Ligne Roset Pop chairs in the sitting area seem to match the spring grass outside.\n\n\n\nYou could say that Viki and Mike matched themselves, too. In 2006, Viki, who was running her own graphic design agency while doing up her home as a sideline, was bored with being single. So her brother said that if she would roast a chicken, over supper he would post online dating profiles for Viki as well as himself.\n\n\n\nA home needs colour: lime green chairs echo the spring grass in the garden\n\n\n\nNot long after that, Viki arranged to meet Mike. “We were inseparable from that moment. My friends all said, ‘He’s the one’,” she says. The new couple owned their flats in Chiswick and Clapham, but a year after getting married in 2007, they bought a house in Clapham Common that had been hacked into five bedsits, and set about turning it back into a single home.\n\n\n\nMike, who had a consultancy business, loved doing this as much as Viki. The couple had already completed six refurbishments between them, so they hatched the idea of turning their passion into a joint career. Viki would handle design and Mike, with his project management background, the process. But when should they make the leap? Life is always about timing, and their son Leo’s birth at the end of 2012 was the turning point.\n\n\n\nThey wanted a property to turn into a family home, with a generous garden as a priority. In early summer 2013 they saw a plain-looking Seventies townhouse advertised by Knight Frank.\n\n\n\n“Within 72 hours we bought it,” says Viki. “I’d already designed a basement while we were viewing.” Desirable Spencer Park is surrounded by a big loop of grand Victorian houses. In 1972, a speculator demolished one mansion and replaced it with a terrace of four modern houses, one of which the Landers bought.\n\n\n\n“It was hideous,” says Viki. “There was a tired white kitchen, nonsensical room divisions, a stupid staircase stuck in the middle and a plastic extension on the back, complete with plastic windows, that the neighbours called the Taj Mahal.\n\n\n\n“The garden was a thicket of overgrown climbers and rotten decking.”\n\n\n\nSince the house was set on a deep concrete slab, Viki had the bold idea of carving out a 16ft-deep basement under the garden to make a playroom for Leo and a top-of-the range gym for her and Mike. “Everyone said that was mad,” she says.\n\n\n\nThey sailed through planning without a hitch, broke ground in March last year, and finished just nine months later, moving in two days before Christmas.\n\n\n\nThe den: friends thought the couple were “mad” to have a 16ft basement carved out of the garden but it created space for a gym for Viki and Mike and a playroom (above) for their son, Leo\n\n\n\nThat sort of excavation comes at a price, of course — not to mention 250 skips full of rock and subsoil that thundered relentlessly out of the front door on a conveyor belt. The family sensibly decamped to a rented flat.\n\n\n\nOn the ground floor the house has been opened up and the staircase shifted to one side, making a huge, bright living space, with the former garage turned into an office for the couple’s new design business. This sleek space flows through to the garden, which has an impressive light oak deck that turns out to be a modern composite — no splinters for tiny feet — and three big Portuguese pom pom laurels.\n\n\n\nRight down to the coffee maker, everything in this home has been considered, particularly for colour. Against the grey wool carpet and soft Little Greene Limestone paint that runs throughout, Viki has used strong, contemporary colours, but these are softened by the luxurious, heavy, shot silk curtains in the bedrooms, and interesting bespoke feature wallpapers.\n\n\n\nIn the third bedroom, for example, the wall the bed sits against is covered in a photographic paper of vivid birds perching on the boughs of trees.\n\n\n\nIn the couple’s own large en suite bathroom, the floor is patinated block parquet — a surprise against the imitation marble ceramic tiles, but it works well, and adds a hint of Versailles ballroom to the overall boutique look.\n\n\n\nWhat is particularly nice about this house is that this Seventies building, which once seemed a fish out of water in such a historic area, now has the right interior to help it stand out.\n\n\n\nWHAT IT COST\n\nHouse in 2013: £2.05 million\n\nMoney spent (if all fees had been included): £1.49 million\n\nValue now: £4 million (estimate)\n\n\n\nGET THE LOOK	2017-06-26 11:42:33.890185+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	20	846	['Philippa Stockley']

1210	Italy agrees €5.2bn bailout plan for struggling Veneto banks		http://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1618050/veneto-banca.jpg	http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/italy-agrees-5-2bn-bailout-plan-struggling-veneto-banks-1627788	\N	The Italian government has unveiled plans to bailout struggling Banca Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca to the tune of €5.2bn (£4.6bn, $5.8bn).\nItalian banks had already pumped €3.4bn into the two struggling banks and had indicated they would not stump up more money.\nHowever, their stance changed after realising the prospect of winding down the two Veneto banks could be a lot costlier.\n"These measures will also remove €18bn in non-performing loans from the Italian banking sector and contribute to its consolidation," she added.\nThe rules also stated national authorities would no longer be responsible winding up struggling banks, a task which would instead fall onto the Single Resolution Mechanism.	The Italian government has unveiled plans to bailout struggling Banca Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca to the tune of €5.2bn (£4.6bn, $5.8bn).\n\nLast week, the European Central Bank warned the two lenders, both based in the Veneto region, were at risk of failing after loan writedowns led to a combined 2016 loss of €3.4bn and pushed their capital below minimum thresholds.\n\nIntesa Sanpaolo, Italy's largest bank, will take control of the banks' so-called "good assets" after paying the symbolic price of €1. Meanwhile, the branches and employees of the two lenders will effectively become part of the Intesa Sanpaolo group from Monday (26 June).\n\nRome had offered to lead the bailout, only for EU competition authorities to stress an injection of private capital was one of the requirements to be met for the rescue plan to go ahead.\n\nItalian banks had already pumped €3.4bn into the two struggling banks and had indicated they would not stump up more money. However, their stance changed after realising the prospect of winding down the two Veneto banks could be a lot costlier.\n\nPaolo Gentiloni, the country's prime minister, said the bailout was a necessary measure to ensure "the good health of our banking system" and to protect savers. The Italian government has also committed to offer guarantees of up to €12bn for potential losses to Intesa deriving from bad loans.\n\n"Those who criticise us should say what a better alternative would have been. I can't see it," Italy's Economy Minister, Pier Carlo Padoan, told a press conference.\n\nWinding down the two banks would have resulted in approximately 4,000 job losses and Margrethe Vestager, the European Commission competition commissioner, said the bailout will prevent an "economic disturbance" in the region.\n\n"These measures will also remove €18bn in non-performing loans from the Italian banking sector and contribute to its consolidation," she added.\n\nCrucially, however, the bad assets, which amount to around €17bn, have been left on the books of the Italian government. The move has left analysts unimpressed, particularly as it contravenes the EU bail-in rules set out in 2016, which stipulate that before a single euro of taxpayers money could be used to bailout a failing bank that share and bond holders should absorb the cost.\n\nThe rules also stated national authorities would no longer be responsible winding up struggling banks, a task which would instead fall onto the Single Resolution Mechanism.\n\n"As with most things in the EU it didn't take long for this approach to hit the buffers on the altar of political expediency, and next year's Italian elections," said CMC chief market analyst Michael Hewson.\n\n"So much for the so called new single European rule book and the much vaunted European Banking Union [...] Let's hope the Italian government has deep pockets given that this particular bailout is a fraction of the non-performing loans in the Italian banking system, of which it is estimated there are about €300bn."\n\nItaly's banking system is indeed saddled with bad loans worth a combined €350bn, which amounts to a third of the Eurozone's total bad debts.\n\nIn December, Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS), the world's oldest surviving lender, was forced to ask for state help to cover a €8.8bn funding black hole, prompting Rome to set up a €20bn fund to help struggling banks.\n\nEarlier this month, the Italian government and the European Commission agreed a bailout plan for MPS, which included severe job cuts and losses for some of its investors.	2017-06-26 11:42:45.247229+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	21	856	['Dan Cancian']

To ensure its appeal continues, Nissan has made some small but extensively-applied tweaks. Making the best better still, it hopes – and helping it hold onto its remarkable UK overall third best-selling car status.\n\nThe objective has been to improve an already good car, by listening to customers, finding out what they don’t like about the current one, and fixing it so they should be more likely to buy another one. There are mods across the board, from plusher design, finish and refinement, to more equipment, to better suspension and steering.\n\nNissan has introduced a new trim line called Tekna+. To the DAB radio that’s now standard on all Qashqai, it adds nappa leather upholstery, Bose sound system, panoramic glass roof and distinctive satin-finished roof rails.\n\nIt’s all crowned by a more distinctive front end that has an aggressive-looking grille, new headlights, tighter bonnet creases and adaptive LED headlights on top-spec models. It’s distinctive before you even step in: do so and the flat-bottom steering wheel and new seats stand out; it immediately feels nicer to sit in.\n\nThose in the rear still don’t fare as well as those in the front, due to more austere trim, but at least the big glass roof of this Tekna+ lets in plenty of light. Everyone should find the more supple ride pleasing as well: Nissan’s set the springs softer and firmed up the front anti-roll bar to compensate. Only sharp town ridges cause a fuss, and most of that is just noise.\n\nNissan’s clever Active Ride Control system has been enhanced; it’s even better at using gentle brake pressure and engine braking to smooth out sleeping policemen. At speed, better noise insulation means refinement is better, and turning into corners feels eager enough for a crossover, even if it does still roll a fair bit.\n\nOur test Qashqai used a 161bhp 1.6 DiG-T turbo petrol, which needs around 3000rpm to wake up, but is very smooth and consistent once up to speed. The alternative128bhp 1.6 dCi turbodiesel remains clattery, despite Nissan insisting it’s been retuned to make it quieter.\n\nThe Nissan Qashqai is a fundamentally well-designed and good quality car. What this facelift does is step up the comfort levels, make it smoother and sleeker to drive, and give it a smart new face that should certainly ensure interest in showrooms remains high. The competition is growing by the week, but the Qashqai still has what it takes.\n\nNissan Qashqai 1.6 DIG-T 163 Tekna\n\nLocation Vienna, Austria\n\nOn sale Now\n\nPrice £27,450\n\nEngine 4 cyls, 1618cc, turbodiesel\n\nPower 161bhp at 5600rpm\n\n​Torque 177lb ft from 2000-4000rpm\n\nGearbox 6-spd manual\n\n​Kerb weight 1483kg\n\nTop speed 124mph\n\n​0-62mph 8.9sec\n\nEconomy 47.1mpg (combined)\n\nCO2/tax band 138g/km, 26%\n\nSearch for used cars	2017-06-26 11:42:36.520686+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	20	848	['Rob Adams Autocar']

He knows how to make an entrance: a pre-recorded mock national anthem (“God Bless Our Robbie”), a feverish build-up modelled on a title fight, a couple of chest-beating tunes and the emphatic announcement, “My name is Robbie f***ing Williams!”\n\nDuring blustering album title track The Heavy Entertainment Show, female dancers arrived wearing boxing gloves and not much else. Williams also dressed for the weather in a skirt, which he hoisted up to reveal his pants.\n\nIt was a typically cheeky opening followed by a rabble-rousing Let Me Entertain You. But the singer wasn’t at full strength: a bad back meant he had to sit down for a few songs.\n\nThe injury didn’t dampen a pyrotechnic-fuelled performance that was both self-confident and a little needy as he admitted to chart setbacks, jokily predicting a career in panto. Last year’s album was his 12th No 1, but lacked hits. Williams narrowly missed the top 20 with Love My Life, which he crooned while nestling on a giant boxing glove above the audience. In contrast to the sugary ballad about parenthood, Motherf***er was a furious celebration of dysfunctional families.\n\nFor all Williams’s vaudeville tendencies, such as the daft duet of Somethin’ Stupid with a fan obliged to wear a voice-distorting mask, his set was a jubilant journey through a life in pop.\n\nAs he marched along the ego ramp belting out debut single Freedom, Williams displayed the puppyish charm of two decades earlier. Generously, he also revisited both spells in Take That — the boyband denouement of Never Forget and their rousing reunion on The Flood.\n\nThe easy listening of Sweet Caroline was in honour of his club singer father, Pete, who sang with him on an incongruous sofa.\n\nFor the encore, Williams stopped talking about himself and dedicated his biggest hit to those who “tragically lost their lives in Manchester and London”. Accompanied by 80,000 fans, Angels was the perfect stadium singalong from pop’s ultimate entertainer.	2017-06-26 11:42:38.995661+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	20	850	['Andre Paine']

In this investing column, it is inevitable that there will be a skew towards investment opportunities rather than reasons to stay away. After all, if an investor is specifically looking for reasons not to invest, he or she will always find them.\n\nAnd at present, such reasons are in ample supply – geopolitical concerns, populism, punchy valuations, a lack of inflation, a weak oil price and so on.\n\nAdd to this a situation where quantitative easing (QE) has yet to be unwound in the world's largest economies, interest rates perhaps need to rise at a faster rate than they currently can on the path to normalisation.\n\nA heady mixture.\n\nAnd yet, there are equally opposing and positive factors – a generally recovering economic recovery, dividend yield which tend to outpace both government bonds and certainly cash, strong corporate earnings, companies (both quoted and unquoted) awash with capital for investment, and equities remaining the investment destination of choice.\n\nThe availability of excess capital could be deployed in any number of ways – increased dividends, share buybacks, acquisitions, investment in staff and/or technology – all of which would be more beneficial to the wider economy than remaining unused on the company balance sheet.\n\nIndeed, many of the reasons not to enter the market have sidelined investors – both retail and professional – with the result that in 2016 they would have missed a 14.4% return on the FTSE 100 and in 2017, 4% in the year to date – and these returns do not include dividends, which should add another 3.5% or so annually.\n\nIn such times of uncertainty, an alternative investment approach is not to start from the "top down" as described above in economic and global terms, but to take a "bottom up" approach.\n\nThis approach is almost defensive in that it seeks to identify individual companies by looking at, inter alia, a strong and stable cashflow, diversification in terms of both geography and business lines, and an enduring franchise with pricing power and growth potential.\n\nThese companies in turn will tend to exhibit higher dividend returns which, as we have described in previous columns, can then benefit from the wonders of compound interest when reinvested.\n\nPerhaps the world's most famous exponent of the bottom up approach is Warren Buffett, a man who has always looked for companies which are surrounded by an "economic moat", ensuring a consistently high return on capital. This may be because there are high barriers to entry for other competitors to start up in the sector, because the company has predictable earnings or keep a strong balance sheet without too much borrowing – or all of the above.\n\nHaving identified such a company – "Only buy something that you'd be perfectly happy to hold if the market shut down for 10 years" – he concludes that "Our favourite holding period is forever."\n\nSome of this wisdom was gleaned from Buffet's own mentor, another famous investor Benjamin Graham, who was of the opinion that "In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run it is a weighing machine."\n\nAs such, opportunities remain, even at the market's slightly higher levels of valuations. In the next column, we will look at applying these principles and identify a couple of examples of (UK) stocks with enduring appeal – the kinds of stocks of which Warren Buffett might approve. At the same time we will highlight how their performance – and prospects – set them apart from the crowd.\n\nAt the same time, we will highlight how this fits in with rest of the investment jigsaw we have been describing in my columns to date – a longer term horizon, psychological detachment, an ability to look through the "noise" and how picking individual stocks might compare with an individual's attitude to risk and capital and/or income requirements.\n\nRichard Hunter is the Head of Research and investment committee member at Wilson King Investment Management .

It's a wonderful feeling to win here again because I'm not sure if I'll ever get a chance to win this again so it's important to enjoy this one."\n\nHaving returned after a long break, Federer's grass-court season did not start well, suffering a loss in the first round of the Mercedes Open at the hands of Tommy Haas.\n\n"I was doubting myself a little bit, I must admit, because losing [in the opening] round for the first time in 15 years on grass was always going to shake me a little bit and it did," he added. "So I'm happy to react right away and let that be forgotten and actually move on and remind myself I actually can play well on grass."\n\n"It's a boost for me personally, with my confidence, knowing that my body is in good shape. Mentally, I'm fresh again and I've gotten used to match play."\n\nAnother victory in Halle next year could make Federer just the second player to win the same tournament 10 times after the feat was achieved by Rafael Nadal this year with his wins in Monte-Carlo, Barcelona and the French Open.\n\nAs for the 18-time Grand Slam champion's defeated opponent, Zverev, the young German revealed that he was unable to play his best tennis due to Federer's aggressive game, but remains confident ahead of Wimbledon.\n\n"I think Roger is playing really, really well," Zverev explained. "I think going into Wimbledon he's going to be probably the favourite to win the whole thing. So credits to him, he played an unbelievable match."\n\n"Of course I could have played better but he didn't really let me play my best tennis. He messed with the ball a lot. He played very aggressive... I think he deserved to win.\n\n"I think it was a very good week for me again making the finals here. Of course I'm upset with the loss, but going into Wimbledon I feel very confident I can make a deep run there."	2017-06-26 11:42:41.295537+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	21	852	['Abhinav Kini']

France has proposed that it wants to extend the country's state of emergency for a further two months. The status was initially declared after the Paris terror attacks in November, but is now sought to cover the Euro 2016 football championships.\n\nPrime Minister Manuel Valls said the government will seek parliament approval to make sure extra powers are granted to police and, with the status' current period due to expire on 26 May, the new rule would remain in place up to the end of the international football tournament on 10 July.\n\nBoth the final and the opening game will be played at the Stade de France, the stadium in northern Paris that was targeted by three suicide bombers on 13 November, during a friendly match between France and Germany. "The state of emergency can't be a permanent condition, but during major events like this thought it necessary to extend it in order to ensure full security," Valls told French Info radio.\n\nThe proposed extension of state of emergency measures would also cover the Tour De France, another major sporting event taking place across France between 2-24 July.\n\nThe measure has already been extended four times since it was first called by President Francois Hollande in the immediate aftermath of the coordinated shootings and bombings that killed 130 people in the French capital. It gives security forces ample freedom of action, enhancing their powers to search and detain and has so far been credited with leading to hundreds of arrests.\n\nHowever, rights groups have criticised the government for alleged abuse ofn the measures. In February, Human Rights Watch said police used the greater power they had been entrusted with to carry out "abusive and discriminatory raids and house arrests against Muslims". In November environmental activists were also lamented, as the state of emergency was reportedly used to curb their right to protest in the run up to the COP21 climate talks in Paris. which ran on 28 November.	2017-06-26 11:42:46.234629+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	21	857	['Umberto Bacchi']

A new video released by an unofficial YouTube channel claiming to be affiliated with the hacktivist collective Anonymous reportedly claims that Nasa is about to announce evidence of alien life.\n\nThe video includes excerpts from three articles that appeared on the conspiracy website Ancient Code, which is registered in Croatia, the Daily Mail reported. The video comes after Nasa's recent announcements of Kepler discovering hundreds of new potential exoplanet candidates, 10 of which are believed to be Earth-sized and might be habitable and could further the hunt for alien life.\n\nAnonymous' video centres on Kepler's latest discovery and also features comments from Nasa's Science Mission Directorate associate administrator Thomas Zurbuchen, who during a US congressional hearing in April, spoke about the various exciting discoveries and advances recently made by the space agency.\n\n"Taking into account all of the different activities and missions that are specifically searching for evidence of alien life, we are on the verge of making one of the most profound, unprecedented, discoveries in history," Zurbuchen said during the congressional hearing of the committee on "Advances in the Search for Life."\n\nIt is important to note, however, that although Zurbuchen's comments are reflective of his and the scientific community's enthusiasm about advances made in the search for extraterrestrial life, they do not hint at Nasa potentially having discovered any real evidence of intelligent alien life. Instead, reports speculate that his comments indicate the various recent discoveries of exoplanets. These include the Trappist-1 "sister solar system", hinting at the possibility of the existence of Earth-like habitable planets, which may play host to microbial extraterrestrial life.\n\nAlthough the purported Anonymous video's claims may appear far-fetched, the hacktivist collective is not alone in assuming that alien life exists. Space tycoon Robert Bigelow, whose firm Bigelow Aerospace manufactured expandable space habitats for the International Space Station (ISS), said aliens may have already visited Earth and may even be living among humans.\n\nAccording to various astronomers, we could likely discover evidence of the existence of alien life in the next few decades. One astronomer recently said we could discover evidence of alien microbial life within the next 10-15 years. However, famed astrophysicist Neil DeGrasse Tyson said in a recent Reddit AMA that the likelihood of discovering complex and intelligent extraterrestrial life within the next 50 years is slim to none.\n\nMeanwhile, the US government has also increased focus on expanding its space divisions within its military, in anticipation of potential space warfare.\n\nAnonymous' new video hints at how the hacktivist group appears to have veered off course. The group was once well known for launching massive campaigns related to prevalent socio-cultural issues, including playing a key role in the Arab Spring. But according to experts, the group seems to have lost its way.\n\n"To my mind Anonymous, by and large, is overpopulated by blowhard script kiddies who barely understand politics let alone hacking," Rik Ferguson, a security expert and close advisor to Europol said at 2017's Infosecurity Europe.	2017-06-26 11:42:48.288568+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	21	859	['India Ashok']

The Young Money rapper is set to release his fourth studio album Views From The 6 on 29 April and it could feature a special appearance from his favourite Boy Better Know MC.\n\nSkepta, real name Joseph Adenuga, is currently putting together his upcoming album Konnichiwa but states that he decided not to ask Drake, 29, to feature on his own record. In a candid interview with Beats 1 Radio host Zane Lowe, Skepta said of their anticipated collaboration: "We're trying to do something for his record, it makes more sense to be on his record rather than mine. Trying to rush fake music or trying to act like you two are friends... We're just eradicating all that and just doing greatness as friends."\n\nThe rappers have built a friendship over the last couple of years and most recently collaborated on the acclaimed remix of Wizkid's afrobeats song Ojuelegba. In March 2016, Drake announced while on stage at Section Boyz's gig in London that he had signed to Skepta's Boy Better Know record label, which also hosts the MC's brother JME. Drake, real name Aubrey Graham, later confirmed the news on Instagram writing: "The first Canadian signed to BBK. Big up my brudda @skeptagram for life yeah. And my section gunners too."\n\nDrake and Skepta, 33, have shared the stage together multiple times in recent months, most notably during Drizzy's headline set at London's Wireless festival in July 2015. An official tracklist for the Canadian rapper's Views From The 6 album is yet to be released but it is expected to feature collaborations with Popcaan, Wizkid, Jay Z, Kanye West and Pimp C with production once again from his long-time colleague Noah "40" Shebib.\n\nThe Hotline Bling hitmaker has plenty to celebrate before the album is even released as his latest track One Dance, which features Wizkid and Kyla, is on course to enjoy its second week at number one on the UK charts having shifted more than 72,000 units combined. Ahead of the release of Views From The 6, Drizzy has also opened a pop-up store in New York City where fans can buy new merchandise in relation to the album.\n\nSkepta is due to release Konnichiwa on 6 May and told DJ Lowe that he has felt pressure to deliver a perfect album since announcing the record in 2015. The MC explained: "I'm not gonna ever announce that I'm going to do an album again. Waking up with that on your head almost doesn't allow you to make the best album you can.

Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has urged the new government to hold its promised referendum on whether to leave the European Union as soon as possible because the uncertainty is affecting business confidence.\n\nDavid Cameron's Conservative Party pledged during the election to hold a referendum before the end of 2017 to allow the British people to decide. However Carney think that is too far away and the uncertainty is bad for business.\n\n"The government has made it clear that [the referendum] is a priority. I am sure the government will act with appropriate speed in developing the negotiations ... as soon as necessary," Carney told Radio 4's Today Programme.\n\n" It's in the interests of everybody that there is clarity about the process and the question and the decision."\n\nAlthough businesses weren't yet putting off major investment plans, Carney believes the longer the referendum is delayed, the more major companies would get the jitters. The EU, he said, is "the largest economy in the world. It's our largest investment destination. It's the largest investor in the United Kingdom."\n\nCarney said he had talked to lots of bosses who, he said, were "aware" of political uncertainty, partly due to the election and partly over Europe.\n\n"What they've been telling us, and we see it in the statistics, is they have not yet acted on that uncertainty - or to put it another way, they are continuing to invest, they are continuing to hire."\n\nCarney also spoke about productivity in the UK, which he did not believe was adversely affected by the influx of migrants from across the European Union and elsewhere. Carney noted that the number of older workers from the UK were having a much larger impact on the nation's productivity.\n\n"In the course of the last two years the number of older workers in their fifties or sixties that have stayed in the labour market is around 300,000 more and people want to work more hours, so we have another 200,000 to 300,000 more workers."\n\n"When you compare that to the increase in net migration, the first two numbers add up to more than 500,000, while the increase in net migration is 50,000."	2017-06-26 11:42:59.633306+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	21	869	['Mark Piggott']

However, even Agassi could not inspire a title defence from the Serbian, who was knocked out in the quarterfinals at Roland Garros by Dominic Thiem, with the former world number one basically giving up in that final set, which was won by the Austrian to love.\n\nFederer and Rafael Nadal have already shown the golden era of tennis is not quite over, there is still plenty left in the tank. But, with Djokovic now set to become a father for a second time – his wife is expected to give birth in August-September – is that desire, so crucial to get that ruthlessness on the court, even there for the 12-time major winner?\n\nMcEnroe feels the fact that Djokovic is now working with a spiritual adviser in Pepe Imaz is leaving him without the edge, the "killer instinct."\n\n"From an emotional standpoint he perhaps felt he wanted to bring in somebody who wants to give people a lot of hugs," McEnroe said of Imaz who is known for his long hugs. "That does not necessarily translate to having that killer instinct.\n\n"It does not automatically lose it, but you don't want to get into a situation where it is all peace and love and then have to go out and try to stomp on somebody's head in competition."\n\nDjokovic has clearly lost the mental strength that made him near unbeatable at times. Look back during his insanely-good run, and you will find multiple times when he dug himself out of a hole the size of the Grand Canyon, purely through of that mental strength and belief in his ability.\n\nNow, when Djokovic goes down a break or two or a set, he just seems to give in, much like he did against Thiem, something which would have been almost impossible to fathom 12 months ago.\n\nEven that joy, he used to emit whenever he stepped onto the court seems to have dimmed a little. Have his priorities changed, and is there a serious basis to the rumours that have said the great man might just be ready to retire?\n\nMaybe what Djokovic needs is a little break to re-evaluate his priorities and find that sweet spot of his again. It worked for Federer and Nadal, although those were injury enforced, and maybe, after Wimbledon and the US Open is done, the Serb can get away from the game, take a nice break and return as the Djokovic we all know.\n\nWho knows, even before that, maybe the Agassi partnership will start to work like a charm, and Djokovic will be the one standing proudly on Centre Court with that famous golden trophy in his hands again in about three weeks' time.\n\nThe way things stand, though, that looks extremely unlikely.\n\nNovak Djokovic on Pepe Imaz's influence	2017-06-26 11:43:00.863998+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	21	870	['Deepak Vikraman']

As she turned for the cameras, her dress's placement moved, letting the flashes get a good view of her curves and nipples, resulting in an unfortunate wardrobe malfunction.\n\nRisking a see-through outfit at the event seemed like a trend last night as many decided to ditch lingerie for the night. Unlike Lee, actress Nafessa Williams stunned in a black sheer dress that played tricks with your eyes. The barely-there outfit left very little to the imagination and highlighted her hot curvy body.\n\nLa La Anthony also chose to hit the nude button as she wore a sparkling gown and looked drop-dead gorgeous.\n\nBlac Chyna also flaunted her assets in an eye-catching see-through dress.\n\nTamar Braxton also hid her assets behind a crochet-inspired white shimmery gown that highlighted her booty.	2017-06-26 11:42:50.852734+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	21	861	['Dishya Sharma']

Undefeated Australian boxer Jeff Horn is set to face his biggest test inside a boxing ring this weekend when he goes up against the WBO welterweight champion Manny Pacquaio. The two are set to square off on July 2 at the Suncorp Stadium in Horn's hometown, Brisbane.\n\nLast week Horn said he was confident he would end the Pacquaio era and become the new WBO welterweight champion. Now, the Australian's trainer has come out with a statement. This is set to be the biggest fight in Horn's career and whatever the outcome, it will set the tone for the rest of his career.\n\nAlso read: Jeff Horn confident he will end Manny Pacquiao era\n\nThe Australian might not have fought a lot of big names but he does know what it takes to knock people out as he has done so 11 times so far and his trainer Glenn Rushton said this fight is going to be better than any of Pacquiao's previous fights.\n\n"I have no doubt this is going to be a much better fight than we've seen against Floyd Mayweather, even Jessie Vargas and Timothy Bradley," ABC quoted Rushton as saying.\n\n"Jeff would fight Manny in a phone booth if he had to. We actually wanted the smallest ring we could get because we want Jeff attacking Manny all the time, putting him under the worst pressure he's ever faced."\n\nThere is no doubt that Horn is the underdog heading into this fight but the former schoolteacher seems really confident about his chances and is reportedly following a 10-point plan.\n\n"It's a plan I've heard him speak to me about 1,000 times. It's perfectly worded. Reading over it is just like listening to him talk to me in the ring. What he's written down is spot on and I can get the job done if I follow it 100 per cent," Horn said.\n\n"He only sent it to me on the weekend and just said to read it over a few times and make sure I've got it clarified, what I need to do."\n\nAs mentioned above, this is set to be the biggest fight of Horn's career so far and the Australian said that having the fight in Australia will be a massive boost to the sport in his country. He also mentioned that if he were to get the win it would change Australian boxing big time.	2017-06-26 11:42:52.030088+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	21	862	['Bryan Rodrigues']

Newly promoted Newcastle United are monitoring the situation of Real Madrid's second choice goalkeeper Kiko Casilla.\n\nThe Magpies gained promotion to the Premier League last season and are looking to bolster their squad with the hope of retaining their top-flight status.\n\nBut despite owner Mike Ashley pledging to support manager Rafael Benitez and give him "every last penny," the club's only signing this summer has been Christian Atsu for a fee in the region of £6.2m ($8m).\n\nThe lack of transfer activity has frustrated Benitez, especially as they were also in pole position to sign Chelsea's Tammy Abraham on loan, only to see Swansea City reportedly now lead the race.\n\nHowever, according to the Chronicle Live, the Spaniard is now using his contacts in his home country to lure players to Tyneside.\n\nOne of those players is Casilla, who was managed by Benitez during the latter's brief stint at the Bernabeu. The 30-year-old joined Madrid from Espanyol in 2015 but has seen his role reserved to being the second choice goalkeeper to Keylor Navas.\n\nWith just 15 league appearances in two seasons along with Madrid's everlasting interest in Manchester United's David de Gea, the chances of Casilla getting regular game time are slim.\n\nWith Newcastle looking to strengthen in the goalkeeping department, the club is monitoring the Alcover native's current transfer situation.\n\nCasilla is not the only La Liga player the Toon are interested in as they are looking to finalise a deal for Eibar defender Florian Lejeune as well, having been in discussions with the Spanish side for over two weeks.\n\nNewcastle have also made it clear that they are willing to take some of Los Blancos' talented youngsters on loan this season.	2017-06-26 11:42:53.140872+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	21	863	['Abhinav Kini']

Dominic Lever was left heartbroken and in tears on Sunday night's (25 June) episode after discovering that his villa beau Jessica Shears allegedly cheated on him with fellow Love Island evictee Mike Thalassitis.\n\nBut viewers were left confused when glamour model Jess was seen crying on the spin-off show, Aftersun, before vehemently denying that she had slept with semi-pro footballer Mike, who also shut down the rumours in his interview with Caroline Flack.\n\nShe said: "It's making me so angry. I can't even tell him (Dom) because I'm stuck..."\n\nShe also told Flack: "Absolutely nothing happened. It's absolutely laughable."\n\nBoth Jess and Mike said that they were "chaperoned" after leaving the luxury Spanish villa and had separate rooms, adding that neither of them had gone into each other's space. Jess claimed that the only time she went to Mike's room was to knock on his door in the morning to wake him after he overslept.\n\nA mysterious source previously claimed to The Sun that Shears had done the dirty on Dom, telling them: "Jess and Mike fancied the pants off each other from the minute they met – last night was the perfect opportunity to enjoy time together in private off-camera and they didn't waste a moment.\n\n"When they left the villa they dropped off their bags at the hotel where they were both booked to stay, enjoyed a few drinks with the crew and then snuck off secretly."\n\nTwitter went into a frenzy, however, after Jess was seen quickly moving her hand from Mike's lap when the camera focused on them before an ad break.\n\nOne viewer said: "Please tell me someone else saw Jess move her hand FAST of Mikes leg on the adverts just now lol!" as another put: "#jess how quick to move your hand ".\n\nA third added: "This whole situation seems all a little bit fishy!

But, it seems the company has hit a bump as retail stores are refraining to stock up their inventory with new phones.\n\nThe primary reason being the start of the new GST (Goods and Services Tax) reform, which is scheduled to kick off across India on July 1.

The world of e-commerce is constantly evolving in the digital age. At its core is the central premise that commerce is no longer about merely shipping or providing products, but also about becoming an enhanced service provider, monetising the service provision via a subscription model and using data to expand and understand customers' needs.\n\nFor Tien Tzuo, co-founder and chief executive officer of Zuora, an emerging software-as-a-service (SaaS) company, that's the new 'subscription economy' he has become a global evangelist for. "We're not talking of linear periodical, website or product subscription, but a whole new shift to subscription-based business models, data analytics and complex billing structures they demand."\n\nIt would be unsurprising to find media companies on the company's portfolio, but Zuora, which was founded in 2007 – and derives its own name from a combination of the surnames of its three founders 'Cheng Zou, Tien Tzuo and K.V. Rao' – today boasts of a client portfolio as diverse as global consultancy Deloitte, French rail operator SNCF and the city of Bristol's Internet of Things (IoT) bidding vehicle, alongside publishing giants such as Nikkei and News UK.\n\nSubtle changes in global commerce\n\n"In the last decade, I started noticing subtle changes in global commerce. Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software, hitherto deployed for more simplistic shipping out of products, or selling individual units of products, was starting to feel outdated," the Zuora boss recounts.\n\nBeing among the 'original forces' at Salesforce.com, and having spent nine years there, Tzuo decided it was time to take his next professional step. "My career has always been about seeking the next big disruptive idea in enterprise software, and the then nascent 'subscription economy' provided the perfect challenge.\n\n"In the last decade, we had the likes of Netflix and Zipcar bringing the 'pay-as-you-go' subscription service in their own ways for very different business streams. Both Zipcar and Netflix had to rebuild complete back-end technology platforms for this changed world. The idea was fairly revolutionary at the time. I took a step back and wondered if it could be applied more widely using SaaS platforms."\n\nTzuo wanted to provide a new set of tools for emerging e-commerce players and founded Zuora with partners. "Our journey began, not by displacing legacy IT platforms at customer facing outfits, or by attacking industry behemoths head on, but by realising that business is shifting to towards a belief that companies needed to wake up become holistic service providers."\n\nThe tech industry veteran, an engineering graduate from Cornell and MBA from Stanford, uses two retail giants to offer a case in point. "For instance, when you login to Amazon, its retail platform gives you an idea of everything you've ever purchased from Amazon going back 10 years, but Walmart doesn't do that despite a third of the US population using it.\n\n"So on a scale level, the latter is bigger that the former, but Amazon's targeting of its customers and its service, based on gathered analytics, is very different from Walmart's. Amazon is not just providing a sales point,= but a service."\n\nThe same concept attuned and applied to a different business stream by Netflix helped it take out the incumbent Blockbuster, and enabled Zipcar to cause discomfort for established car rental businesses, and spawn rival businesses with similar business models. "That's the pace of change of the subscription economy we're talking about."\n\nBack to 2007 and the first wave of clients\n\nIn terms of Zuora's own client portfolio, Tzuo says it was "fairly easy" for the company to get critical mass via its first few clients 10 years ago. "The reason for that is – our model, both back then and now, is to keep eyes and ears close to the ground in all the different industries. Our vision is not to come up with one product for one sector, rather have diversity in our portfolio."\n\nZuora's "first wave" customers were software companies (e.g. Zendesk), and the clients roster soon broadened to include hardware companies. The second wave of clients included the digital media companies, such as Reed Business Information, HBO, News UK and the Financial Times, who found its Paywall 2.0 strategy helped them realise it isn't about "selling the content anymore but servicing the readership behind a responsive subscription-based model."\n\nThen along came the IoT enthusiasts; a really broad category. "That's anything from physical devices to cars, wearables to healthcare; we're customer data mining for them all – discovering everything from flooring panels choices of homeowners to pedestrian traffic. This also opens up avenues for us to either sell the data or develop value added apps to service our clients on the back off that."\n\nOf course, individual sectors are marching to their own subscription economy Alamo at different paces. "We are innovators who enable the new economy. Some clients are in the nascent stages of their journey, i.e. linear one-to-one digital subscriptions, and there are others who have moved well beyond that to core analytics of their subscribers, using it to enhance their offering and develop products to gain yet more subscribers.\n\n"Our engine gives you the ability to customise interactions at various price packages, there's no one size fits all, nor will everyone adapt at the same pace. For instance, I don't see the retail sector exploding for us in the next 12 months. However, in five years time everything is in play."\n\nThe road ahead\n\nAs of now, the company's primary focus remains on North America and Europe, and in Asia its key markets remain China, Japan, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nTzuo doesn't see the subscription economy reversing and denting his company's pitch to the world. "Subscription-based business model is growing nine times faster than the S&P 500, and that tells you something. I don't see the trend reversing for some time."\n\nThe company's customer base is nearly 1,000 strong with $40bn (£31.4bn) in invoice transaction volume, earning Tzuo EY's Entrepreneur of the Year award in 2016, among other accolades for the company and his team.\n\nAs for the road ahead, Zuora's founder says his company will grow in step with the global transition to subscription services. "Our revenue model is correlated to the clients' revenue model – they grow, we grow! Looking ahead to the next five years, we're really interested in looking at sectors where we have not been in before, for instance services offered by airlines.\n\n"The insurance industry is another one for us to explore, to help insurers target different demographics, and explore a diverse and fine-tuned range of product price points."\n\nIt seems prospects and possibilities appear to be sound - both for the subscription economy and its chief global evangelist.	2017-06-26 11:42:56.493689+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	21	866	['Gaurav Sharma']

An investment fund owned by Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman has agreed to buy the UK's biggest health foods retailer, Holland & Barrett, for £1.8bn ($2.3bn).\n\nIt is the first acquisition made by L1 Retail, which was set up last year by Fridman's holding company LetterOne.\n\nHolland & Barrett, which sells a range of nutritional supplements and wellness products through 1,150 stores in over a dozen countries, is owned by private equity firm Carlyle Group.\n\nThe Financial Times reported that Peter Aldis, the chief executive of Holland & Barrett, will stay on at the company after the transaction, which is expected to close by September.\n\nHolland & Barrett had also attracted interest from Hong Kong-based AS Watson, the largest health and beauty retailer in Asia and the owner of Superdrug, Perfume Shop and Savers in the UK.\n\nSky News reported last week that talks between AS Watson and Carlyle Group were at an early stage and that they may not lead to a formal bid.\n\n"They may simply be kicking the tyres, but there is some interest from them," a source was reported as saying.\n\nHolland & Barrett operates around 600 wholly-owned stores in the UK and employs more than 4,200 people.

Infosys has said that automation related attrition has hit 11,000 jobs. The revelation was made during the Indian IT-giant's 36th Annual General Meeting held on Saturday, June 24. Numerous things such as the retirement of executive chairman R Seshasayee and the rumoured tiff between the company's board and its founders were also discussed.\n\nWhile the firm did not specifically say whether the company had let go of the 11,000 employees and even did not mention a time period, it did say that software has been and is going to play an important role in its business model. Talking about the benefits of automation, the Bengaluru-based firm also said that revenue per full-time employee had increased by 1.2 percent.\n\nInfosys has of late made quite some headlines, thanks to reports of several employees being laid off and its plans to hire 10,000 employees in the US. While it has time and again said that the reports of layoffs are unfounded, citing how each year employees are evaluated and non-performers are let go, its statement at the AGM is likely to raise a few eyebrows.\n\nAutomation has been a much-discussed topic in the recent times. Apart from laying off several employees, IT giants are also said to be hiring lesser number of employees each year and automation is said to be one of the key reasons. Most of the companies now rely on digital services.\n\n"With automation, the number of people we are hiring in the past will not be the same. It will slow down a little bit. We are also looking at hiring very differential kind of people," the Indian Express had earlier quoted Krishnamurthy Shankar, executive vice-president, group head, human resource development, Infosys, as saying.\n\nPankaj Bansal, co-founder and chief executive officer of PeopleStrong, noted that the job cuts due to automation may not show a drastic impact right away, but it will be visible by around 2020. "The change has started, with companies introducing bots for customer service, managing warehouses, etc.," he told LiveMint.\n\nMeanwhile, Seshasayee said that the Saturday meeting was his last AGM as he is set to retire in May 2018 and explained that he is looking for to a smooth transition.\n\n"Finally, as this will be my last AGM, before I retire upon reaching the age of 70 in May 2018... During the remaining part of my tenure, I would be committed to further enhancing governance standards, improving shareholder value and planning a smooth transition to my successor," he said.	2017-06-26 11:43:06.682283+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	21	875	['Vanilla Sharma']

Iranian president Hassan Rouhani has spoken out against the crackdown on women by 7,000 morality police recruited to step-up monitoring of mal-veiling or behaving 'inappropriately'. Since the extra police began their work on 16 April, women as young as 12 have reported being stopped by the armed police, who have questioned whether they are properly dressed and threatened them with prison.\n\nBut when Rouhani was asked about the work of the morality police by Iran's semi-official news agency ISNA, he said the government's role was not to undermine people's dignity.\n\n"Our first duty is to respect people's dignity and personality.

American actor Doris Roberts, better known for her role as the loving yet meddling mother of Ray Romano in the popular sitcom Everybody Loves Raymond, passed away on 17 April due to natural causes. The 90-year-old actor had been much more than an on-screen mother to Romano, who remembers her affectionately.\n\n"Doris Roberts had an energy and a spirit that amazed me. She never stopped," Romano, who plays the title character in the show, told the People magazine. "Whether working professionally or with her many charities, or just nurturing and mentoring a young, green comic trying to make it as an actor, she did it all with such a grand love for life and people and I will miss her dearly," he added.\n\nRoberts' co-stars in the popular CBS show, Romano and Patricia Heaton, were among the first to react to her demise.

My wonderful TV mother-in-law and ELR nemesis Doris Roberts was a consummate professional from whom I learned so much."\n\nOver a period of more than six decades, the celebrated actress won five Emmys, four for her playing the role of the sharp-tongued Marie Barone — mother of Raymond.

French far-right leader Marine Le Pen is to travel to the UK to campaign for the country's exit from the European Union. Eurosceptic Le Pen has previously claimed that a potential Brexit would hasten a French exit as a result, reports France 24.\n\nIn recent years, Le Pen's Front National party has made significant gains in regional and European French elections, driving its current campaigning on an anti-EU, anti-Islam platform.\n\nIn the coming weeks, Le Pen will travel across the channel to appear alongside pro-Brexit candidate, MEP Janice Atkinson, who was expelled from Ukip last year.\n\nLe Pen has said she supports Brexit as she believes it would hasten the collapse of the EU, and result in France's ultimate exit. "(British departure) will prove that it is possible to live outside the European Union. Either we are free or we are not," Ms Le Pen said recently, according to The Independent.\n\nAtkinson, who represents south-east England in the European parliament, is a member of Le Pen's European parliamentary group. She was expelled from Ukip in March 2015, after her chief of staff was alleged to have attempted to inflate her parliamentary expenses. Police took no action against Atkinson.\n\nLe Pen's participation in the Brexit campaign is unlikely to be welcomed by Ukip leader Nigel Farage, who has refused to join forces with Le Pen's Eurosceptic coalition in Brussels, and has described FN as a racist party.\n\nIt comes as a new poll in French newspaper, Le Figaro, today (20 April) showed increasing opposition to Brexit amongst the French public. Previously polls were equally divided, but the most recent survey shows 54 per cent of the French public opposes Britain leaving the union.	2017-06-26 11:43:12.089743+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	21	880	['Tom Porter']

Arsenal may still have to increase their offer to sign Alexandre Lacazette, who could still opt for a move to Atletico Madrid, says Lyon club president Jean Michel-Aulas.\n\nAtletico had been expected to seal a move for the France international after he came to a "verbal agreement" with the club earlier this year but a transfer ban imposed upon Diego Simeone's side opened the door once again for the Gunners.\n\nThe Guardian claims Arsenal have lodged a club-record bid of £44m ($56m) for Lacazette. Aulas has now confirmed that offer, but says the both he and the 26-year-old could still decide on doing business with Atletico instead, even though it would mean waiting until January 2018 – when the Spanish club are eligible to register new players again.\n\n"I do not intend to cede Alexandre quickly, because there is always the will of Atletico Madrid to bring it to January 1. Now I also listen to what Alexandre says," Aulas told L'Equipe.\n\n"I saw Arsene Wenger during the France-England match [on June 13]. I was with [Aulas' adviser] Gerard Houllier and I understand he told Gerard there could be interest from Arsenal, but it's premature to say that things will happen."\n\nAulas also explained Atletico's offer is marginally better than Arsenal's, something the Premier League side are well aware of.\n\n"We are talking about €50m to €60m [£44m-£53m], Arsenal are ready to pay for Lacazette. It will have to be at least that," he continued.\n\n"Everyone knows that Atletico's offer is €53m plus €12m. That's €65m [£57m]. As the leaders of Arsenal are well informed, they will be in those waters. But frankly I have not thought about Arsenal for the moment. I thought Alexandre would stay because of the failure, initially, with Atletico Madrid."\n\nArsenal have made one addition to their squad already this summer, signing full-back Sead Kolasinac on a free transfer from Schalke.	2017-06-26 11:43:16.685404+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	21	884	['Tony Mogan']

Off-road enthusiasts are waiting for the launch of Jeep Compass in India. The most affordable made-in-India Jeep model is expected to enter the market sometime in August. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) India, the parent company of Jeep India, has already revealed most of the details of the Compass except the price. It looks like the proposed Goods and Service Tax (GST) starting from July 1 will dictate the pricing.\n\nAlso read: After Jeep Compass, FCA to launch Renegade compact SUV priced under Rs 10 lakh\n\nEarlier reports suggested Jeep would price the Compass from Rs. 15 lakh. Even at the rumoured price, the compact SUV is a compelling case against Hyundai Tucson and Skoda Yeti. Now, a report in Financial Express suggests prices might go below Rs. 15 lakh, thanks to GST.\n\nCurrently, SUVs attract an overall incidence of above 50 percent, which would come down to 43 percent (GST of 28 per cent and cess of 15 per cent) after GST kicks in. With local production of Compass, Jeep may able to price the compact SUV very competitively at less than Rs 15 lakh.\n\nThe Compass is set to be the volume driver not only for Jeep India but also for FCA. The Fiat marquee under FCA is not doing great in terms of sales in the country. Hence, FCA and Jeep will make sure the Compass will be priced right.\n\nThe initial impressions are in favour of the Compass. Early numbers show the Compass has garnered 1,000 bookings in just three days after the pre-bookings started. A source told International Business Times, India that the Kochi dealership has received 50 bookings on day 1. This is an overwhelming response since other models of Jeep such as the Wrangler and Grand Cherokee got a lukewarm response in the country. Wrangler starts at around Rs. 56 lakh while the Grand Cherokee costs between Rs. 93 lakh and Rs. 1.1 crore.\n\nThe Compass has confirmed a 2.0-litre MultiJet diesel engine and a 1.4-litre MultiAir turbo petrol engine options under the hood. The diesel mill will develop 170hp and 350Nm of torque mated to a six-speed manual transmission. On the other hand, the petrol mill will belt out 160hp. A six-speed manual and a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic will be offered with the petrol mill.	2017-06-26 11:43:17.650089+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	21	885	['Ken Sunny']

Chelsea are increasingly confident of completing a deal in signing Juventus defender Alex Sandro in the summer transfer window.\n\nAccording to Goal.com, Antonio Conte has identified the 26-year-old as a priority target in the wing-back position. He is currently earning £75,000-a-week ($95,580 per week) and his contract with the Turin club runs down in 2022.\n\nJuventus are keen on retaining the defender and are ready to offer him a new deal, which will include an improved wages. The Serie A outfit are waiting for a final decision from the player and his agent.\n\nIt is believed that Sandro will formally communicate his decision to leave the Italian outfit in favour of a move to Stamford Bridge. If the talks go in the English champions' favour, the Brazil international is set to become Chelsea's major summer signing. Sandro is expected to cost Chelsea around £60m ($76.5m).\n\nShould the deal go through, he will become the most expensive signing in the Blues' history, beating their current record of £50m ($63.7m) they paid to Liverpool in signing Fernando Torres in January 2011.\n\nThe Premier League winners are looking to strengthen their squad for the next season as they return to the Champions League after a year's absence. Conte has identified Sandro's club teammate Leonardo Bonucci as also a summer transfer target.\n\nChelsea have already lost their club legend John Terry after the former England international announced his decision to leave the club after the end of the last season. The 30-year-old Italian centre-back can replace Terry if he decides to reunite with Conte at Stamford Bridge.\n\nIt should be seen whether Juventus will be willing to allow two of their defenders leave the club in the summer transfer window, especially after losing Dani Alves. The Brazil international wanted to leave the Old Lady and the Serie A winners decided to terminate his contract.	2017-06-26 11:43:18.673876+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	21	886	['Naveen Ullal']

Microsoft has announced that it has stopped manufacturing Xbox 360 consoles ten years and five months since its initial launch in November 2005. The console will continue to be sold and will still receive a full range of Xbox Live services.\n\nThe news came from Xbox boss Phil Spencer in a blog post heavily-laden with praise for the immensely successful console, which had sold 84 million units as of the last official figures in June 2014. The system is likely to be around the 90 million mark at least by now.\n\n"Xbox 360 means a lot to everyone in Microsoft," said Spencer in the statement. "And while we've had an amazing run, the realities of manufacturing a product over a decade old are starting to creep up on us. Which is why we have made the decision to stop manufacturing new Xbox 360 consoles. We will continue to sell existing inventory of Xbox 360 consoles, with availability varying by country."\n\nThe post also outlines how the system will continue to be supported.\n\nXbox 360 owners will continue to receive Xbox Live services for their console, such as online multiplayer gaming and parties, access to the apps they use today, and Games with Gold and Deals with Gold.\n\nXbox Live servers that support Xbox 360 services will also remain online and active.

Microsoft's Xbox Live Arcade and annual Summer of Arcade event fostered and publicised the digital releases of indie games like Braid, Limbo, Bastion, Castle Crashers, Geometry Wars 2 and Shadow Complex - and played a major factor in the thriving indie scene we still see today.\n\nFor all the latest video game news follow us on Twitter @IBTGamesUK.	2017-06-26 11:43:20.992837+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	21	888	['Ben Skipper']

Gwyneth Paltrow has turned her health and wellness brand Goop into a multi-million dollar enterprise but it looks to have been done at a cost to unsuspecting customers. The company was recently pulled up for wrongfully promoting its line of Body Vibes stickers that claim to "rebalance the energy frequency in our bodies".\n\nAccording to the Goop website, the stickers that sell at $60 for a pack of 10, are made of 'conductive carbon material, the same stuff used to line Nasa's spacesuits'. "Human bodies operate at an ideal energetic frequency, but everyday stresses and anxiety can throw off our internal balance, depleting our energy reserves and weakening our immune systems," the product description read.\n\n"Body Vibes stickers (made with the same conductive carbon material Nasa uses to line space suits so they can monitor an astronaut's vitals during wear) come pre-programmed to an ideal frequency, allowing them to target imbalances."\n\nIt seems now, that the claims made by Goop are absolute poop, as stated by a Mark Shelhamer, former chief scientist at NASA's human research division.\n\n"Wow," he told Gizmodo. "What a load of BS this is.\n\n"Not only is the whole premise like snake oil, the logic doesn't even hold up. If they promote healing, why do they leave marks on the skin when they are removed?" he added, referring to reviews that the stickers left traces on the body of users.\n\nAnother Nasa representative told the website that the space agency "(does) not have any conductive carbon material lining the spacesuits".\n\nFollowing these statements, Goop decided to edit it's product description and told Daily Mail that it would be looking into the claims by the company from which it had sourced the stickers.\n\n"As we have always explained, advice and recommendations included on Goop are not formal endorsements and the opinions expressed by the experts and companies we profile do not necessarily represent the views of Goop," it said in a statement.\n\n"Our content is meant to highlight unique products and offerings, find open-minded alternatives, and encourage conversation. We constantly strive to improve our site for our readers, and are continuing to improve our processes for evaluating the products and companies featured.\n\n"Based on the statement from Nasa, we've gone back to the company to inquire about the claim and removed the claim from our site until we get additional verification."\n\nThe sticker producers, Body Vibes stuck by their claims that they had "found a way to tap into the human body's bio-frequency" but later announced that their company's engineer was "misinformed by a distributor" about the material being the same as that used by Nasa.\n\n"We apologise to Nasa, Goop, our customers and our fans for this communication error.

Authorities in southern Spain evacuated nearly 1,500 people on Sunday (25 June) after a forest fire broke out near the famous Donana National Park at Moguer in Andalusia.\n\nThe fire reportedly broke out on Saturday night and was still not under control through Sunday. Emergency services said ten helicopters, seven planes and four water-bombing planes were deployed to deal with the blaze, according to AFP news agency.\n\n"The fire has entered in the limits of the reserve, and that is where we are focusing our efforts," Jose Fiscal, deputy head of the regional environment protection authority, told Spanish television on Sunday. He added that the evacuated people were staying at a campsite.\n\nAuthorities are still trying to evaluate the scale and the cause of the blaze. Regional president Susana Diaz visited the affected area and said that "the human factor cannot be excluded" with regard to the cause of the fire.\n\nDiaz also said that hot and dry weather with temperatures reaching 39 degrees Celsius, and shifting winds were making it difficult to control the fire. She added that more than 550 firefighters, soldiers and police officers supported by 21 air units were fighting the blaze.\n\nSpanish interior minister Juan Ignacio Zoido said that they were "taking special measures, even though the wind is pushing the fire toward (the reserve) to keep the damage to a minimum".\n\nThe Donana nature reserve in the Andalusia province of Huelva, which is popular for its biodiversity and has earned a UNESCO world heritage site status in 1994, is visited by hundreds of tourists every day. It is home to a wide variety of endangered species like the Iberian lynx and the Spanish imperial eagle.\n\nEcologists fear that the raging fire could completely wipe out some of the nature reserves' prized species and terrain. The nature reserve protects more than 100,000 hectares of the landscape that is deemed of high ecological value.\n\n"We are worried because the impact could be huge," Carlos Molina, an ornithologist who works inside the reserve, told the Associated Press by phone.\n\n"Donana is probably one of the most important areas for birds in all of Europe, and we just happen to be in a nesting season for several species," Molina added, noting that the endangered Iberian imperial eagle does not seem to be in danger due to the fire but the endangered lynx is in immediate danger.\n\nThe fire incident in Spain comes just a week after deadly wildfires killed more than 60 people in neighbouring Portugal.	2017-06-26 11:43:33.801378+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	21	900	['Ananya Roy']

Live 2015-16 Barclays Premier League Full-time: West Ham 3-1 Watford Full-time: Manchester United 2-0 Crystal Palace Manchester United ease to their sixth consecutive home victory with a confident performance against their fellow FA Cup semi-finalists at Old Trafford\n\nDamien Delaney gave the hosts an early lead courtesy of a comical own goal\n\nMatteo Darmian doubled the advantage 10 minutes after half-time, volleying in off the post for his first goal in English football\n\nLouis van Gaal's side trail fourth-place Arsenal by a point before the Gunners' clash with West Brom on Thursday\n\nAt Upton Park, Mark Noble notched a brace of penalties as West Ham beat Watford to keep their own top-four hopes alive\n\nAndy Carroll boosted his faint Euro 2016 hopes with a sixth goal in as many games, while Troy Deeney missed from the spot\n\nSebastian Prodl netted a consolation for the visitors, who will be without Nordin Amrabat at Wembley after the Moroccan was sent off for two bookable offences\n\n22:01 That is all for this live text, so thanks for joining us. Stay tuned to IBTimes UK for all the latest reaction from tonight's games and check back tomorrow as my colleague Josh Evans brings you that meeting between Arsenal and West Brom at the Emirates. Goodnight.\n\n21:59 Victory was simply never in doubt for United tonight and they close the gap on Arsenal in fourth to just a solitary point ahead of the Gunners' clash with West Brom on Thursday. Next up is out of sorts Everton at Wembley. The Toffees have hardly enjoyed the best preparation for that match after being thrashed 4-0 by Liverpool in the 226th Merseyside derby at Anfield. As for Palace, they stay 16th and nine points clear of relegation danger. Pardew's troops clearly already had one eye fixed on Sunday's FA Cup semi-final meeting with Watford.\n\n21:48 Herrera lashes over the crossbar after Valencia's searching cross is knocked down by Fellaini. His blushes are spared as the referee blows for a foul on the towering Belgian.\n\n21:46 Three additional minutes to be played. Is there really any point?\n\n21:43 Smalling has been hobbling a little bit here, but looks to have shaken off a little knock. Darmian winds up another long-range effort, but this time the Italian drags his shot wide of the post.\n\n21:38 Back at Old Trafford, Fellaini has come on for Rooney and Memphis just curled an effort narrowly wide. Smalling takes the captain's armband for the final few minutes. This game has merely become a glorified training exercise for United.\n\n21:37 A miserable night for Quique Sanchez Flores is compounded as Amrabat receives a second booking for bringing down Winston Reid. He will now miss Sunday's semi-final against Palace.\n\n21:34 Watford's penalty saga continues. This time they get one of their own as Angelo Ogbonna fouls Prodl, but Troy Deeney's low effort is saved by Adrian.\n\n21:32 Pardew makes his final change, withdrawing Adebayor and throwing on Wickham. It's been a difficult night for the Togolese striker, who has had very little service to work with and has been pitted against a vastly improved centre-back in Smalling.\n\n21:29 Mariappa takes matters into his own hands to ignore Speroni and deflect a dangerous cross behind. Smalling fails to make a proper connection with Martial's pass and Van Gaal replaces Lingard with Herrera.\n\n21:26 Palace have offered virtually no attacking threat in this second half and once again Smalling eases possession away from Adebayor.\n\n21:23 A hearty round of applause for Rashford, who makes way for Memphis. Pardew sends on McArthur in place of Cabaye. Both of those substitutions no doubt made with this weekend's FA Cup semi-finals in mind.\n\n21:20 How has that not gone in? Rashford is sent through by a good low pass from Valencia. He leaves Mariappa on his backside before unselfishly squaring for Lingard, whose shot is blocked by Speroni. Rashford then has a go himself from the rebound but the goalkeeper is there again to save. Darmian has been booked for a push in the back on Zaha.\n\n21:17 A first change of the evening for Pardew sees Lee replaced by Jordan Mutch.\n\n21:16 De Gea looked to be moving rather gingerly following that earlier brush with Valencia. He seems OK to continue, however. Looking for a third goal, Martial balloons high over the crossbar after impressive play from Lingard and Rooney.\n\n21:14 Darmian has endured something of a difficult first season in English football since his move from Torino in July 2015. He deserves some acclaim here, though, shrugging off the weak challenge of Sako to volley in off the post after Delaney had looked to clear Mata's corner. A stunning first goal for the club.\n\n21:11 A slight mix-up between David de Gea and Valencia almost opens the door for Lee to run through on goal. At the other end, Rashford goes down in a heap following a strong challenge from Mariappa and Mata's shot at the near post is deflected wide by Speroni.\n\n21:07 A lifeline for Watford in east London as Austrian international Prodl beats Adrian with a fine left-footed volley.	2017-06-26 11:43:25.942478+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	21	893	['George Flood']

An oblivious fan leaning over a barricade into the line of traffic to snap a photo of cyclists in the Tour of Italy bike race triggered a major accident that left the overall leader with a dislocated shoulder and another cyclist with a broken bone.\n\nItalian rider Daniele Colli was racing up the side of the road during a sprint at the climax of Stage 6 of the legendary race when he struck the spectator's camera and telephoto lens, crashing to the ground and breaking his arm.\n\nA moment later leader Alberto Contador of Spain went flying, too, along with several other riders , reports the BBC. Contador climbed back on his bike and finished the stage that ended near Castiglione della Pescaia.\n\nColli, who suffered a compound fracture, later tweeted from a hospital bed that he was doing OK, and he thanked all his well-wishers. He said it was unfortunate that he crashed because someone was careless and that cyclists risk their lives and to please respect their work.\n\nIt's not clear if the spectator was identified or if the fan faced any kind of penalty.\n\n"I haven't broken anything, but I have suffered a dislocation of the left shoulder," Contador said in a statement. "The doctors have recommended that I immobilize my left arm during the evening and night, while I try to move it a bit with the help of my other arm to promote the movement of the shoulder.\n\n"I will try to start tomorrow on stage 7," he added. "I will try to continue until the very last moment.

Israel's 34th government in 67 years was sworn in on Thursday 14 May amid chaotic scenes in the Knesset (Parliament).\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's fourth government of 20 ministers barely scraped in with a 61-59 majority, and political pundits are already saying new elections are likely within a year. Some Israeli commentators called the manoeuvring "farcical", while others described proceedings as a "circus".\n\nNetanyahu's number two in Likud, Gilad Erdan, refused to join the cabinet, declining the prime minister's offer to serve as public security minister. He demanded the Foreign Ministry, which Netanyahu kept for himself in case he will be able to expand his coalition late on.\n\nBut Erdan later arrived at the Knesset in order to vote in favour of the new government, which would enable it to be approved by the Knesset. "The swearing-in of a Likud government is a happy occasion but I am sad personally about the developments with me," Erdan said.\n\nHowever, with so many senior figures in his own party, such as Erdan, feeling snubbed - and public unease at the financial price Netanyahu has had to pay to cobble together his coalition - speculation was rife knives would be out soon.\n\nNetanyahu told the Knesset that all the problems building his government proved that the electoral system needed to be changed.\n\n"The current system encourages exaggerated demands by parties and individuals," Netanyahu said. In his speech, Knesset Speaker Yuli Edelstein called the need to change the system "the elephant in the room".\n\nNetanyahu turned to Opposition Zionist Union leader Isaac Herzog and pleaded with him to join the government in order to help change the system. But Herzog rejected the offer in a fiery address, mocking his desire to advise the world on how to negotiate with Iran after he botched the coalition talks.\n\n"This is not the government the people wanted," Herzog said, turning to Netanyahu. "Your partners swindled you. What you created was a circus. Your mentors Ze'ev Jabotinsky and Menachem Begin would have been embarrassed of you. Your way is not my way. My way is the way of the Labour movement that founded this country. Give the Foreign Ministry to one of your MKs. No decent leader would join your circus."\n\nWhen Netanyahu said his new government would pursue peace, opposition legislators laughed at him. Arab MPs played a tape of Netanyahu complaining about the Arab turnout in the 17 March election, heckled the prime minister, and then were expelled from the plenum.\n\nMeanwhile, ratings agency Moody's warned Netanyahu that his new government will struggle to meet its fiscal targets because of spending promises he made to rope in his coalition partners.\n\nThe warning was one of the first signs from the business community that the concessions Netanyahu made to smaller parties, which have already weakened the long-serving prime minister politically, could hurt Israel's economy, too.\n\n"The compromises negotiated to form the latest government could lead to a deteriorating, instead of an improvement, in the budget deficit in 2016," Moody's said.\n\nAmong the promises Likud made to its new partners was to exempt some food products from value added tax and to increase child allowances. Moody's estimated that the total cost of these changes would reach 8bn shekels (£1.33bn, $2bn), or nearly 1% of GDP.	2017-06-26 11:43:28.553846+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	21	895	['Joe Millis']

Further, social media campaigns have raised a flag and urged people to stock up medicines in advance.\n\nThe stock in retail stores in Bengaluru has gone down by 50% in the past two and a half month. The stores which used to keep a 40-day stock have cut down the period to 20.\n\n"Dear customer, due to GST transition, please expect drug shortage in July and plan your purchases in advance to avoid inconvenience," read an SMS sent by Family Pharma, a chain of chemist stores operating in Bengaluru, read a report.\n\nStaple food becomes expensive\n\nCome July 1, branded rice will get expensive by 5% per kilogram.

Manchester United are edging closer towards completing a deal in signing Chelsea star Nemanja Matic.\n\nAccording to ESPN FC, the Red Devils are set to secure the deal for the Serbian international before the end of the week. The 28-year-old played under Jose Mourinho when the latter was in charge at Stamford Bridge.\n\nThe Portuguese tactician re-signed the midfielder for the Blues from Benfica in January 2014. He played a key role in their title winning season under Mourinho at Chelsea. The United manager now wants to reunite with his former player at Old Trafford, who would cost them £40m ($50.9m).\n\nMatic has emerged as a priority signing for the former Inter Milan and Real Madrid manager. Mourinho has identified the need to strengthen the defensive midfield position and Tottenham Hotspur's Eric Dier had earlier emerged as the main target.\n\nUnited have received no encouragement in their efforts in signing Tottenham's England international star. The situation has forced them to look elsewhere and have identified him as the main target. It was earlier reported that Matic had verbally agreed personal terms with the Red Devils. However, that has been rubbished by the club.\n\nChelsea manager Antonio Conte has identified AS Monaco's Tiemoue Bakayoko as the player to strengthen his side's midfielder. The 22-year-old France international is expected to complete his £35m ($44.6m) move to the west London club.\n\nThe Blues are confident of securing the deal for Bakayoko before they fly to China for the pre-season. His imminent arrival will allow them to sanction Matic's sale, who will complete his move to United.\n\nMourinho will take his men to the United States for the pre-season tour. United will fly on 9 July and the Red Devils boss wants a majority of his signings to travel with the squad early next month. Victor Lindelof, who arrived from Benfica, is the 20-time English champions' only signing so far this summer.\n\nReal striker Alvaro Morata and Inter Milan's Ivan Perisic have also been identified as transfer targets. However, no deal is closer towards completing as Matic is expected to be United's second summer signing.	2017-06-26 11:43:30.814795+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	21	897	['Naveen Ullal']

Hackers are reportedly using the NSA's leaked DoublePulsar malware to infect vulnerable Windows PCs with a new cryptocurrency miner identified as "Trojan.BtcMine.1259". The Trojan reportedly leverages DoublePulsar, an NSA hacking tool leaked by the Shadow Brokers, to infect systems running unsecured SMB protocols.\n\nDoublePulsar was at the heart of the WannaCry attacks and was used by hackers to spread the self-propagating ransomware last month. Security experts estimated that hackers used the NSA malware, which essentially functions as a backdoor, providing access to vulnerable Windows systems, to infect nearly 100,000 Windows PCs.\n\nBleepingComputer reports that the hackers behind the latest attacks are using DoublePulsar to download a malware loader onto victims' systems, which scans computers for minimal kernel threads. In the event that a PC satisfies the parameters required, the malware loader downloads the cryptocurrency Trojan.\n\nSecurity experts reportedly believe that the cryptocurrency miner is a mix of malware variants. For instance, the Trojan uses parts of the Ghost RAT (Remote Access Trojan) to communicate with its C&C (command and control) server and also to hide its activities when victims launch the Task Manager Windows utility.\n\nTrojan mining Monero\n\nThe hackers are using the Trojan to mine for the cryptocurrency Monero, which has recently been increasingly replacing Bitcoin as the primary form of currency used by numerous cryptocurrency miners.\n\nFollowing the WannaCry attacks, security researchers found that DoublePulsar, along with another leaked NSA malware called EternalBlue, was being used in "large-scale attacks" that infected systems with a Monero mining strain called "Adylkuzz".\n\nThe leaked NSA malware strains target PCs running older Windows versions. Microsoft recently announced that it would disable all SMB1 portals to ensure that such attacks are thwarted. Post WannaCry, security experts have advised people to update their Windows systems to the latest versions to remain safe from such attacks.	2017-06-26 11:43:31.846425+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	21	898	['India Ashok']

1255	Who hacked the UK parliament? Russian hackers suspected to be behind attempted theft of MPs' records		http://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1621331/uk-parliament.jpg	http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/who-hacked-uk-parliament-russian-hackers-suspected-be-behind-attempted-theft-mps-records-1627766	\N	Russian hackers are suspected to have attempted to breach and steal sensitive data from MPs' email accounts, specifically targeting those with weak passwords.\nFewer than 90 email accounts of MPs were hacked, according to a parliamentary spokesperson.\nBecause with such an unacceptably-low level of security - they have likely already been reading all emails for many years without leaving a trace," Kolochenko told us.\nA parliamentary spokesperson told the Guardian that the people whose emails were breached by hackers had weak passwords.\nThe hackers attempted to gain access to MPs' accounts, which sparked fears among some of affected individuals that they could potentially be blackmailed by the hackers.	Authorities investigating the 12-hour-long cyberattack on the British parliament suspect the hand of Kremlin-linked hackers.\n\nRussian hackers are suspected to have attempted to breach and steal sensitive data from MPs' email accounts, specifically targeting those with weak passwords.\n\nThe hackers breached less than 1% of parliament's 9,000 email addresses. Fewer than 90 email accounts of MPs were hacked, according to a parliamentary spokesperson.\n\nThe Guardian cited an unspecified security source as saying that the breach that began on Friday (23 June) was a "brute force attack" and that it "appears to have been state-sponsored".\n\n"A simple brute force attack can normally be detected and blocked within a minute. This incident highlights once again that cybersecurity fundamentals are ignored even by the governments of leading countries," Ilia Kolochenko, CEO of security firm High-Tech Bridge, told IBTimes UK.\n\nAlthough investigation is still in the early stages, Moscow is one of the primary suspects. MPs said that apart from Russia, suspicion has also fallen upon North Korea. Both nations are known to have launched cyberespionage campaigns against Britain in the past.\n\n"Such an attack is very simple and cheap to organise, and virtually any teenager could be behind it. However, for this particular incident, I would abstain from blaming any state-sponsored hacking groups. Because with such an unacceptably-low level of security - they have likely already been reading all emails for many years without leaving a trace," Kolochenko told us.\n\nA parliamentary spokesperson told the Guardian that the people whose emails were breached by hackers had weak passwords.\n\n"Investigations are ongoing, but it has become clear that significantly fewer than 1% of the 9,000 accounts on the parliamentary network have been compromised as a result of the use of weak passwords that did not conform to guidance issued by the Parliamentary Digital Service," the spokesperson said.\n\n"As they are identified, the individuals whose accounts have been compromised have been contacted and investigations to determine whether any data has been lost are under way."\n\nThe hackers hit the network used by both houses of parliament. The affected network is used by every MP, including Prime Minister Theresa May and members of her cabinet. The hackers attempted to gain access to MPs' accounts, which sparked fears among some of affected individuals that they could potentially be blackmailed by the hackers.\n\nThe cyberattack came on the heels of news breaking out about MPs' records being traded on Russian-speaking hacking forums on the dark web.\n\nThe incident is being investigated by the NCSC (National Cyber Security Centre), which said in a statement that it was "working around the clock with the UK parliamentary digital security team to understand what has happened and advise on the necessary mitigating actions".\n\n"Today, two-factor authentication (2FA), advanced IP filtering and anomalies detection systems are a must-have for critical systems accessible from the internet. Strict password policies, regular audits for weak and non-compliant passwords are also vital for corporate security. However, apparently, none of these simple but efficient security controls were properly implemented," said Kolochenko.	2017-06-26 11:43:35.177724+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	21	901	['India Ashok']
1256	Christoph Mueller accused of running away from his job as Malaysia Airlines CEO		http://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1508816/malaysia-airlines-christoph-mueller.jpg	http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/goran-ivanisevic-picks-rafael-nadal-favourite-win-2017-wimbledon-1555911	\N	Malaysia Airlines Chief Executive Officer Christoph Mueller has come under heavy fire following his decision to leave barely a year into his job at the airlines.\nThe union accused him of running away from his job in the middle of his three-year contract when many people had placed high hopes on him.\nStill stinging from the 6,000 job losses that Mueller brought about at the airlines, the union said that Malaysia Airlines' parent company Khazanah Nasional must "justifiably recruit every single employee who they have terminated," if Mueller fails to stay on.\nMalaysia Airlines' MH370 which was on a routine flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing in March 2014 with 239 people on board disappeared and its wreckage is yet to be found.\nMalaysia Airlines, which underwent a restructuring after the two tragedies, had appointed Mueller to succeed Ahmad Jauhari Yahya as managing director and CEO on 1 May 2015.	Malaysia Airlines Chief Executive Officer Christoph Mueller has come under heavy fire following his decision to leave barely a year into his job at the airlines. Citing changing personal circumstances, the German is scheduled to leave the company, breaking his three year contract.\n\nThe National Union of Flight Attendants Malaysia or Nufam, which took the brunt of his cost-cutting exercise when he took over, had some harsh words for him. The union accused him of running away from his job in the middle of his three-year contract when many people had placed high hopes on him.\n\n"How can you leave the airline halfway when taxpayers have spent so much to bring him over to turn the airline around," the union asked in a statement." The union said that Mueller had to prove to everyone that he is "all worthy of what he has been paid for."\n\nStill stinging from the 6,000 job losses that Mueller brought about at the airlines, the union said that Malaysia Airlines' parent company Khazanah Nasional must "justifiably recruit every single employee who they have terminated," if Mueller fails to stay on.\n\n"We have lost many good employees all because of the management's streams of failures," it said. It also described Mueller as being unprofessional for leaving the national carrier when it has yet to recover from the losses of two Boeing 777s in 2014.\n\nMalaysia Airlines' MH370 which was on a routine flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing in March 2014 with 239 people on board disappeared and its wreckage is yet to be found. Another aircraft MH17 was shot down over Ukraine in July 2014 killing all 298 on board.\n\nMalaysia Airlines, which underwent a restructuring after the two tragedies, had appointed Mueller to succeed Ahmad Jauhari Yahya as managing director and CEO on 1 May 2015. Mueller announced on 19 April that he will step down in September.\n\nNufam speculated that Mueller could have quit because of the "heavy politics" at the airline, saying that although it was not surprised by his decision to leave, they did not foresee this happening so soon into his contract.\n\n"As we predicted last year, there is more than just having to recover those losses [at the airlines]. It's about the legacies and politics that get in his way. We were informed that ideas were ditched at the last minute and U-turn decisions made without proper consultation with Mueller." the union added.\n\nMalaysia Airlines recovery in doubt\n\nThe airline's double whammy with the loss of two aircraft that triggered a RM6bn ($1.55bn) state restructuring last year is seen to be in jeopardy following Mueller's "abrupt" decision to leave. Although the airline is still reported to be in the red, it has improved traffic and on-time performance.\n\n"Mueller is a war general. He came in at the worst time," said Mohshin Aziz, an analyst at Maybank Investment Bank in Kuala Lumpur. "A change of management can't help, a lot of people might feel things are uncertain," he said, according to Reuters.\n\nAn industry source told Reuters: "They need someone with Christoph's vision for the airline's future, the drive to push the changes through, and the nous to manage the politics that come with running a state-owned airline. They did well to get Christoph, but it may be even harder to find an adequate replacement."\n\nMueller previously steered a financial turnaround at Irish carrier Aer Lingus, bringing in experienced executives to lead operations, commercial and marketing teams.	2017-06-26 11:43:36.377502+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	21	902	['Rachel Middleton']
1257	Thought your treasures were 100% safe in lockers? Banks have no liability for loss of valuables, says RBI		http://data1.ibtimes.co.in/en/full/641618/rbi-rbi-mpc-meeting-rbi-bi-monthly-meeting-april-6-sensex-reacts-monetary-review-meeting-rbi.jpg	http://www.ibtimes.co.in/thought-your-treasures-were-100-safe-lockers-banks-have-no-liability-loss-valuables-says-rbi-732262	\N	If you thought that keeping all your valuables in a bank locker was the best way to keep them safe, the idea may not be 100 percent foolproof.\nThe RBI and 19 other PSU banks clearly explained that the bank is not liable for the customer's loss while responding to an RTI application filed by lawyer Kush Kalra on the same.\nThe 19 banks have noted that "the relationship they have with customers with regard to lockers is that of lessee (landlord) and lessor (tenant)".\nHowever, the banks in fact clearly mention in the agreement that the valuables stored in the lockers are at the customer's own risk and it is up to them to get these valuables insured.\nAccordingly, hirers are advised in their own interest to insure any item of value deposited in a safe deposit locker in the bank."	If you thought that keeping all your valuables in a bank locker was the best way to keep them safe, the idea may not be 100 percent foolproof. Sure, it might be better to keep them in safe deposit boxes in banks than your home, but in case there is a theft or burglary in the bank, customers cannot expect the bank to compensate them for the loss, the Reserve Bank of India has said.\n\nThe RBI and 19 other PSU banks clearly explained that the bank is not liable for the customer's loss while responding to an RTI application filed by lawyer Kush Kalra on the same. The 19 banks have noted that "the relationship they have with customers with regard to lockers is that of lessee (landlord) and lessor (tenant)". Like a landlord is not liable for a theft at the tenant's place, a bank also has no obligation to compensate the customers for any case of theft at the bank.\n\nNow, Kalra has moved the Competition Commission of India and has accused the banks of "cartelisation" and "anti-competitive practices," reported the Press Trust of India.\n\nHowever, the banks in fact clearly mention in the agreement that the valuables stored in the lockers are at the customer's own risk and it is up to them to get these valuables insured.\n\n"As per safe deposit memorandum of hiring locker, the bank will not be responsible for any loss or damage of the contents kept in the safe deposit vault as a result of any act of war or civil disorder or theft or burglary and the contents will be kept by the hirer at his or her sole risk and responsibility," most bank agreements usually state.\n\n"While the bank will exercise all such normal precautions, it does not accept any liability or responsibility for any loss or damage whatsoever sustained to items deposited with it. Accordingly, hirers are advised in their own interest to insure any item of value deposited in a safe deposit locker in the bank."\n\nKalra has now questioned that if the bank is not liable for any loss and customer's can keep the valuables in safe deposit boxes at their own risk, why not keep them at home instead and get them insured? The lawyer has now requested a probe into the matter under the Competition Act.	2017-06-26 11:43:37.427195+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	21	903	['Vanilla Sharma']

A teenager from a family he describes as the "Elon Musk version of the Kardashians" has become a millionaire after investing $1,000 (£800) into bitcoin when he was just 12 years old.\n\nThanks to a tip-off from his brother, Erik Finman, from Idaho, US, invested a $1,000 gift from his grandmother into the cryptocurrency in May 2011. At the time, bitcoin was unheard of outside of technology communities and worth around $12 per coin.\n\nFinman told CNBC how he invested in bitcoin as a way of winning a bet with his Ph.D-holding, Stanford-educated parents, who said he did not have to go to university if he became a millionaire by the age of 18.\n\nThat first investment quickly grew from $1,000 to $100,000 by the end of 2013. Finman then sold the lot and used the proceeds to move to California's Silicon Valley and set up a company called Botangle, which allowed students frustrated with the quality of their current education to video teachers to video chat with online.\n\nA year later, in January 2015, Finman found a buyer for Botangle who offered either $100,000 in cash or 300 bitcoins, which was worth less, around $60,000, due to the cryptocurrency being valued at a little over $200 per coin. Finman opted for the less valuable option, believing his bitcoins would appreciate massively over the coming years, becoming "the next big thing".\n\nThrough further investment Finman now owns 403 bitcoins, worth $1.13m at the time of writing, but the currency's extreme volatility means it could rise or fall significantly in mere hours. Finman also has smaller investments in other digital currencies, including litecoin and ethereum.\n\nWhile some analysts think bitcoin is already overvalued, others have recently claimed it has the potential to top $100,000 per coin. Finman, perhaps unsurprisingly, is even more bullish: "Personally I think bitcoin is going to be worth a couple hundred thousand to a million dollars a coin."\n\nAs for the bet with his parents, Finman still has no plans to go to university. Instead, he believes the internet offers a better education for free. "The way the education system is structured, I wouldn't recommend it. It doesn't work for anyone. I would recommend the internet, which is all free. You can learn a million times more off YouTube and Wikipedia."	2017-06-26 11:43:38.547214+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	21	904	['Alistair Charlton']
1259	Former slave Harriet Tubman to become new face of $20 banknote replacing Andrew Jackson		http://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/202195/u-s-dollar-bank-notes-are-seen-bank-budapest.jpg	http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/nasa-about-announce-alien-life-evidence-hacktivist-anonymous-claims-video-1555894	\N	Former slave Harriet Tubman will replace the late US president Andrew Jackson on the $20 bank note, a Treasury official has said.\nAccording to CNN, the soonest, there is a new $20 bill will be in 2030.\nThere is no immediate information on when Tubman will appear on the $20 bill.\nThe $20 bill was not scheduled to be reviewed until 2030.\nI can't think of a better choice for the $20 bill than Harriet Tubman," she said.	Former slave Harriet Tubman will replace the late US president Andrew Jackson on the $20 bank note, a Treasury official has said. She will become not only the first woman on a US paper currency but also the first African-American to appear on a US currency.\n\nThe US Secretary of Treasury, Jacob Lew who made the decision earlier, is expected to make the announcement later on 20 April. The 19th century abolitionist and leader of the Underground Railway, will replace the US seventh president.\n\nLew is also set to announce other changes being proposed to the $5, $10 and $20 bills. The face change to Tubman however is unlikely to take place anytime soon. According to CNN, the soonest, there is a new $20 bill will be in 2030. There is no immediate information on when Tubman will appear on the $20 bill.\n\nThe decision to remove first Treasury secretary Alexander Hamilton from the $10 bill however has been dropped due to popular opposition, AFP reports. According to the US Magazine, Lew came under fire for suggesting that Hamilton's face may be entirely replaced. Critics claimed that Hamilton held particular significance in the US banking system, crediting him for helping to create the modern US financial system.\n\nFollowing the backlash over his initial proposal, Lew told Politico: "There are a number of options of how we can resolve this. We're not taking Alexander Hamilton off our currency. He's one of my heroes. He will be fully honoured."\n\nThe changes follow a review that saw opinions collected from around the country on the proposed redesign of the $10 note. The note was scheduled for redesign in 2020. Lew is also expected to announce that leaders of the movement to give women the right to vote will be on the back of the $10 bill while Hamilton will continue to remain the face of the bill.\n\nGroups like Women on 20s had campaigned to have a woman on a banknote by 2020 to mark the 100th anniversary of American women gaining the right to vote. In a 10-week poll conducted by the group in 2015, Tubman beat Eleanor Roosevelt, Rosa Parks and others by taking 33.6% of the 352,431 votes cast in the final round of the poll.\n\nThey had indicated their unhappiness over initial plans to have a woman share the $10 note with Hamilton, after it was decided that he will not be dropped. The $20 bill was not scheduled to be reviewed until 2030. Women on 20s said on 20 April that while the choice of Tubman was an "exciting one", the change needs to be done earlier.\n\n"What was to be a celebration of female American heroes for our 100th anniversary of inclusion in the democracy cannot be postponed. It's time to get the party started honouring women on the new $10 and new $20 in time for 2020," Barbara Ortiz Howard, the founder of Women on 20s said.\n\n"In recent days, reliable sources were telling us we wouldn't see the redesigned $20 until 2030. Assuming this is true, we see today's announcement as only a vague commitment and a continuation of the now familiar message that women have to settle for less and wait for their fair share," Women on 20s Executive Director Susan Ades Stone said in a statement.\n\nOne person noted on twitter that a black slave was replacing a white slave owner on the US currency. "What a time to be alive," he added.\n\nEven Democrat presidential candidate Hillary Clinton joined in the debate, welcoming the news. "A woman, a leader, and a freedom fighter. I can't think of a better choice for the $20 bill than Harriet Tubman," she said.	2017-06-26 11:43:39.69126+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	21	905	['Rachel Middleton']

Both Iran and Turkey have slammed a list of demands issued by four Arab states to resolve a diplomatic and economic crisis with Qatar as "disrespectful" and "unacceptable".\n\nEarlier in June, several nations across the Arab world cut ties with Qatar after repeatedly accusing it of destabilising the region, a charge that Doha denies.\n\nOn 24 June, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Egypt and Bahrain laid down 13 conditions Qatar needs to meet in ten days to solve the crisis.\n\nThe demands include closing state-funded news outlet Al Jazeera, closing a Turkish military base and reducing ties with Iran. Doha said it was reviewing the list, but added it was not actionable.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said the demands were in breach of international law and said Ankara will not pull out troops from Qatar.\n\n"To ask Turkey to pull out its troops from Qatar is firstly disrespectful behaviour towards us," he said in Istanbul, according to Reuters.\n\n"We don't need permission from anyone to establish military bases among partners. We endorse and appreciate Qatar's stance towards the 13 demands. It's a very, very ugly approach to try to interfere with our agreement."\n\nThe leader added Turkey had offered Saudi Arabia to establish a military base there, but never received an answer.\n\n"If Saudi Arabia wants us to have base there, a step towards this also can be taken," he said. "I made this offer to the king himself and they said they will consider this. They did not come back to us since that day and even though they still didn't come back to us on this, asking Turkey to pull back its troops (from Qatar) is disrespectful against Turkey."\n\nEchoing similar views, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said the ongoing isolation of Qatar was "unacceptable" and he reiterated the country's support to Qatar.\n\n"We believe that if there is a conflict between regional countries, pressure, threats or sanctions are not the right way to resolve differences," Rouhani told Qatar's emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani in a telephone call, according to state news agency IRNA.\n\n"The siege of Qatar is unacceptable to us... The airspace, land and sea of our country will always be open to Qatar as a brotherly and neighbouring country," he continued.\n\nThe diplomatic and economic isolation of Qatar has sparked what has been deemed one of the worst crises in the Gulf in recent years. It prompted Qatari citizens to stockpile goods amid fears food and water stocks would deplete as the country depends on food imports.\n\nIran and Turkey have dispatched food supplies to Qatar. Ankara also sent a small contingent of soldiers and armoured vehicles.	2017-06-26 11:43:40.779399+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	21	906	['Ludovica Iaccino']

The Delhi Police on Sunday, June 25, arrested a 23-year-old woman who is accused of chopping off the genitals of her boyfriend because he refused to marry her. They had reportedly been in a relationship for four years.\n\nThe condition of the 35-year-old boyfriend — a street vendor named Ravi — is said to be stable after he underwent surgery. He is said to be currently admitted to Jaipur Golden Hospital.\n\nThe incident is believed to have taken place on Wednesday, June 21, at the residence of the accused in Mangolpuri in outer Delhi. She had reportedly got a relative of hers to call Ravi to the place.\n\nOnce he arrived, the two talked for a bit before the accused brought up the matter of marriage.

Anyone who picked up a new copy of the New Republic from his or her local newsstand on the morning of 18 July 1955 could have opened it to read an article called ‘How to be happy: installment 1053’. What they couldn’t have guessed is that the author would, in all probability, choose to extinguish his life mere hours later. With a flourish sour, sardonic and elegant, the author would disappear. His name was Weldon Kees.\n\nKees had the knack of being in the right place at the wrong time. As a writer-artist, Kees had been in all the best cultural hotspots of the period. He was in New York in 1943-48 during the early Abstract Expressionist boom, but left before the market took off. He had also been in artists’ haven Provincetown, but had sold relatively little work. In 1950, he arrived in San Francisco. Somehow he had managed to be in these places and failed to make critical breakthroughs. He (and his wife Ann) had quit places without getting the most out of them. He seemed to have turned missing opportunities into his greatest art form.\n\nAdmired for his talents as a poet, storywriter, critic, musician, composer, painter, film-maker and photographer, Kees never broke through in any one field despite his talent. The only thing he had made a sustained success of was reviewing. At parties, the elegantly-dressed figure with matinee-idol looks, cigarette in hand, would cast an acerbic gaze over the assembly. Kees was a good jazz pianist and often played in small bands. His self-deprecating wit and musical skill (not to mention his looks) made him a hit at social gatherings. He did not lack ambition, application or ability and had talent in abundance – perhaps too much talent in too many fields.\n\nLooking at the drinkers around him, Kees sharpened his stiletto-sharp wit for the next conversation or letter. Kees was one of the great letter writers of his time. In long, observant and funny dispatches, Kees documented his misfortunes and the doings of others. Only a limited selection of these letters has been published. A more extensive collection of letters would make an intimate and entertaining insight into American arts of the 1940s and 1950s.\n\nKees had the knack of being in the right place at the wrong time\n\nBorn in 1914, Kees grew up in Beatrice, Nebraska, a small midwestern town. Kees studied English at nearby Lincoln, at the University of Nebraska, where he met fellow student Ann Swan. They would marry in 1937. Already a published writer of short stories, Kees worked as a librarian in Denver before the couple headed to New York. He painted abstract pictures, made collages and published where he could, while all the time earning a living in the film industry. (Kees edited newsreels for Paramount.) He worked on a novel that no one ever found quite satisfactory.\n\nOf all Kees’s output, it is his poems that attract most attention today. Kees’s poems were published in the best magazines and reviews, but his three slender books of verse sold poorly despite positive reviews. His poetry is laconic, mordant and very approachable. In an early two-verse poem he recollected a friend’s funeral.\n\nI remember the clumsy surgery: the face\n\nScarred out of recognition, ruined and not his own.\n\nWax hands fattened among pink silk and pinker roses.\n\nThe minister was in fine form that afternoon.\n\nI remember the ferns, the organ faintly out of tune,\n\nThe gray light, the two extended prayers,\n\nRain falling on stained glass; the pallbearers,\n\nSelected by the family, and none of them his friends.\n\nOddness of tone and morbid subject matter have prevented Kees’s verse appealing widely but through waves of minor revivals it has developed a cult following. In Kees’s sardonic satires of small-town life, an outbreak of premeditated bloodletting or Gothic horror is an ever-present threat. This was no literary stance: Kees believed that culture and civility were a thin veneer.	2017-06-26 23:32:58.712772+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	53	1036

Ecuador has begun burying people killed by the country's deadliest earthquake in decades, as hopes fade that any more survivors will be found. The government has put the death toll at 525, with more than 200 people still missing following the 7.8-magnitude earthquake. Most of the dead were in the Manta, Portoviejo and Pedernales areas.\n\nOfficials expect more bodies to be found. The final toll could surpass combined casualties from earthquakes in Chile and Peru in the past decade. Among the dead were at least 11 foreigners, including an American and two Canadians.\n\nScenes of mourning multiplied all along Ecuador's normally placid Pacific coastline, where the tremor flattened towns and killed hundreds. Funeral homes are running out of coffins to accommodate so many casualties.\n\nThe earthquake destroyed or damaged about 1,500 buildings, triggered mudslides and left some 20,000 people homeless, the government said. It was the worst tremor in Ecuador since one in 1949 killed more than 5,000 people.\n\nA fresh tremor rattled Ecuador overnight, a 6.1 magnitude jolt that was the strongest aftershock since the lethal earthquake. There was no immediate report of further damage. The US Geological Survey said the tremor was centred offshore, 25 kms west of Muisne, at 3:33 a.m. local time. The previous strongest aftershock was magnitude 5.7.\n\nRescuers with sniffer dogs, hydraulic jacks and special probes that can detect breathing from far away continue to search for survivors in the rubble. At least six were found in Manta on Tuesday (19 April).\n\nOne of the most hopeful tales was that of Pablo Cordova, who held out for 36 hours beneath the rubble of the hotel where he worked in Portoviejo, drinking his own urine and praying that mobile phone service would be restored before his phone battery died. He was finally able to call his wife on Monday afternoon and was pulled from the wreckage by a team of rescuers from Colombia. His wife had given up hope of ever seeing him again and had bought a coffin.\n\nRescue workers, who have arrived from Mexico, Colombia, Spain and other nations, said they would keep searching for survivors, but cautioned that time was running out and the likelihood of finding more people alive grew smaller with the passage of every hour.	2017-06-26 11:43:45.009505+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	21	910	['David Sim']

The Syrian army has warned there will be "repercussions" after Israeli forces launched air strikes on Damascus' military positions near the disputed border of Golan Heights. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it carried out air strikes after sporadic projectiles were fired from the Syrian side.\n\nThis was the second such flare-up between the two countries in a short span of two days when Israel attacked Syrian army posts in northern Golan Heights on Sunday, 25 June. There was errant fire from the Syrian side which spilt over to Israeli-controlled territory angering the IDF. The fire from the Syrian territory did not cause any damage or casualty.\n\nThe IDF said its forces struck a vehicle carrying ammunition and two artillery positions in order to contain the situation. Syrian and Lebanese media outlets have also confirmed the attack.\n\n"The IDF is not a side to the internal fight in Syria and isn't involved in it. However, it views with severity any attempt to harm the sovereignty of Israel and the safety of its citizens and considers the Syrian regime responsible for what transpires in its territory," IDF said in a statement.\n\nIsraeli forces have also advised those are in the nearby residential areas to move to a safe zone and avoid open areas.\n\nSwiftly following the Israeli announcement, Syrian army issued a threat saying many were killed in the air strikes. Syrian regime condemned the "aggression in support of terror groups," by the Israeli military, according to the state-run Sana news agency.\n\nIsrael largely remains on the sidelines of longstanding Syrian civil conflict. However, it carries out targeted air strikes against Hezbollah, a traditional arch-rival with which the country fought a war in 2006. Hezbollah, often seen as a long arm of Iran, has sent its fighters to Syria in support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, stepping up its involvement in recent years.	2017-06-26 11:43:45.985014+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	21	911	['Vasudevan Sridharan']

1389	Freedom before liberalism		http://www.spiked-online.com/pettit.jpg	http://www.spiked-online.com/spiked-review/article/freedom-before-liberalism/\n19864\n	\N	So that’s one reason why the idea of freedom as non-interference took off, I think – it justified colonial power.\nThe new way of thinking of freedom as non-interference is welcomed because it justifies the power of employers over employees.\nIronically, those who really develop the idea of freedom as non-interference are the utilitarians, who cannot be described as being right-wing.\nThe idea of republican freedom applied to women would require equality in marriage, and of course the possibility of divorce.\nCould you say a bit more about why democracy is so important to ensuring the flourishing of republican freedom?	So that’s one reason why the idea of freedom as non-interference took off, I think – it justified colonial power. But it also justifies the power of employers in the new industrial period, a period during which all the traditional laws about how a master could treat journeymen or apprentices had become obsolete. Thousands of people were heading to the cities, to gain employment in these new factories. The employers, as we all know, do a blacklist, so if any of them fires someone, that fired employee is put on a blacklist, and probably can’t get a job. So the employers have enormous power over their workers.\n\nIn the older republican terms, that would have been really shocking, because even if the employers are nice to their workers, they’re still in a position of power in relation to the workers, and, worse than that, they can put them on a blacklist at will. The new way of thinking of freedom as non-interference is welcomed because it justifies the power of employers over employees. So if a worker signs a contract, formally or informally, to enter employment, he is agreeing to the terms of the relationship, and it doesn’t matter that it’s a relationship in which you’ve got a master, and you’re effectively a slave. That would have been anathema to the republican tradition.\n\nIronically, those who really develop the idea of freedom as non-interference are the utilitarians, who cannot be described as being right-wing. They’re all for reform and equality of people. Bentham – who argues each to count for one and none for more than one – is a great egalitarian. And what I think motivates Bentham and the theologian William Paley, who’s another significant utilitarian thinker in the 1780s, is that they want equality, but realise that if you hold on to the old notion of freedom as non-domination, then, wow, you’ve really got a powder keg on your hands, because it would overturn master-servant law, the relationship of employer to employee and family law. So I think that they’re under pressure to dilute this idea of freedom, turning it from this richer idea of non-domination to that of laissez faire non-interference. And then they can push their own agenda without it appearing too revolutionary.\n\nreview: You do also make a very strong argument in favour of freedom of choice…\n\nPettit: So in the republican tradition, as I understand it, the focus is on the person, and on the freedom of the person. But in order for a person to be free, two things have to be true. The person has to live under a law that gives him or her a range of choice or discretion in decision-making, where they really can act just as they wish. This is his or her area of independence under the law. Of course, people will always enter relationships, which means they are dependent on others. And that’s fine, so long as they reach out to one another for those relationships from a position of strength, where they really do have this area of independence under the law.\n\nOne reason why the idea of freedom as non-interference took off, I think, was because it justified colonial power\n\nThe second thing that’s needed is that they have to be politically as well as socially free, meaning that the law under which they are personally protected in this space is a law controlled by them equally with others. So they share a system of control over the law. Now that maps on to a notion of democracy.\n\nBut in the tradition as I read it, what’s really important is not just that you have elections – and you do have elections in Rome, as you did referenda – you also have a power of challenging what is happening in the law, through the courts, through demonstrations, by whatever means – the Romans call it provocatio, a right of appealing against the law. So it was never just that you are restricted to the right of the community voting. It also means to challenge a law, and to call for a rehearing of it, so to speak.\n\nreview: You mentioned dependence, or rather ‘dependence on others’, which a is tricky idea in relation to ideas of freedom, because, on the one hand, advocates of freedom would want to defend an idea of independence. But, on the other hand, being dependent on others, perhaps informally, on friends or family, or on others more broadly, to enable or to help you to achieve something, seems like it actually enriches our freedom. So are there forms of dependence that help people to be free?\n\nPettit: This is a really important point. The sort of independence that is important in the republican tradition, as the 17th-century theoretician and parliamentarian, Algernon Sidney, put it, ‘consists in independency upon the will of another’. It’s all about being independent from what others want you to do in a particular area of choice. So you’re guaranteed by the law, and by your informal powers and resources and the support of the community, to be able, if you wish, to act according to your own will in the relevant area of choice – let’s call it the fundamental liberties – regardless of what other people might want you to do. It’s independent of what others will you to do.\n\nNow that, of course, is completely consistent with being dependent on others for the opportunities you have. So I’m travelling to Sidney by bus tomorrow. That’s available to me because of other people – because other people like to travel, bus travel is a mode they are willing to pay for. So I’m dependent in a generic way on other people. That’s not inimical to the idea of of freedom as non-domination. Equally, personal relationships which you choose – relationships of friendship, of love, of commitment – are relationships in which, of course, we do become dependent on others. You don’t just ignore your partner, so to speak, and do whatever you like in the realm of basic liberties. It’s part of having an intimate relationship that you develop a common mind together. But that sort of dependency is chosen. And I would say that you don’t get proper relations of intimacy, proper dependencies and intimacies, unless they are entered from a position of strength.\n\nSo if you go back 100 years, when women were totally dependent on a father or a husband to look after them, at least in the middle part of life. They were in a position of great weakness entering romantic relationships. It’s no coincidence that men abused those relationships in a way that women didn’t. Men wore the trousers, as it were. So while women may not have been interfered with – and liberal freedom means non-interference – they endured a great imbalance of power, and lived, even with a gentle husband, under the husband’s thumb.\n\nFor democracy to flourish, above all you need an active citizenry, which will hold the government to account, ‘to keep the bastards honest’\n\nThe example I always use to illustrate freedom as non-domination is that of Nora and Torvald from Ibsen’s A Doll’s House. It’s set at a point in Norway’s history when women have little legal power. The man has it all: he owns everything; he can dictate whether his wife leaves the house, what she wears, who she associates with. But Torvald dotes on Nora. She is given everything. She really does enjoy freedom as non-interference in the classically liberal sense. What she absolutely does not enjoy is freedom as non-domination in the older republican sense (although of course in the Roman sense it wasn’t applied to women). The idea of republican freedom applied to women would require equality in marriage, and of course the possibility of divorce. It’s no coincidence that John Milton, who was a great republican thinker, wrote strongly in favour of divorce, recognising that in relationships that you can’t exit, you’re going to get domination if one of the parties was of a particular psychological disposition to dominate.\n\nAnd this is a key point: there’s a personal dimension to being a free person, and a political dimension to being a free person. In each case, being a free person means not being stood over; it means not suffering dominatio, which was the word the Romans used for the relationship of the slave to a master, a dominus. It means not suffering that sort of subordination to another. In personal life, it means you’ve got to have an area where you are the boss, even if you choose to bring other people as intimates into that area. And in the political dimension, you’ve got to have a standing of equals with others when it comes to seeking influence over the state, seeking to contest laws and so on.\n\nreview: You write that it’s important that the state ‘guards against itself practising a form of public domination’. Which is where democracy comes in. Could you say a bit more about why democracy is so important to ensuring the flourishing of republican freedom?\n\nPettit: The state, even in the most democratic, communal states, is a corporate agent with enormous power over us. States do have to exist, and they have to be coercive. That’s like gravity – it’s the background to society. Now, how states exercise their power – let’s think of the domestic state – over their citizens is really crucial to the quality of life those citizens enjoy. You can think of this in terms of respect for freedom. So the state has to give respect as equals to all its citizens, meaning more or less permanent, adult, able-minded members of a political community. And it has to respect them as equals. Now that does mean that the decisions of the state, which are always intrusive, because the state is essentially coercive, have to be shaped and disciplined and controlled on terms that appeal across society. So, for example, in a society in which the citizenry is equally protected and empowered, they’re always going to value equality. So any breach in the equal treatment of people is extremely disrespectful. And it means those treated unequally are obviously subject to a dominating state power, because it’s singling them out.\n\nI think that what is really, really essential to a properly democratic state is that it is controlled equally on the people’s terms. You have to have elections; they have to be periodic; they have to be free. But I think it’s equally important that apart from that electoral side, democracy must have a strong contestatory side. And the contestatory side requires two things. On the side on the state, it requires a great deal of sharing of power between different centres of power that can hold one another to account. So, for example, you need an electoral commission that can dictate the boundaries according to which politicians are elected, rather than allowing those politicians to do it themselves – a straightforward abuse that routinely occurs in the US. You’ve got to have auditors that can look at the books of government. You’ve got to have publicity, for instance, of economic data, and so on, which can be scrutinised. You also have to have a central bank that has a relative degree of independence, because politicians have such powerful interests in these areas. You need the courts to be clearly independent. And all of this needs to be transparent, so you need a media.\n\nThe state, even in the most democratic, communal states, is a corporate agent with enormous power over us\n\nBut above all you need an active citizenry, which will hold the government to account, ‘to keep the bastards honest’, as they say in Australia. The reason I’m emphasising this is that there are many on the left, which is my side of the divide, who think we need a more and more inclusive electoral style of democracy. Of course, it’s really important that we have democracy, which is control by the people on their terms. That requires something of far greater complexity than simply some notion of the popular will being imposed on government. There isn’t such a thing as the popular will. What you have to have are the channels by which people with different complaints from different sections of society can keep the sand in the wheels, which otherwise might run a little too smoothly in the direction of those in power.\n\nNow all of this requires transparency, and the involvement of the people, not just at the moments of elections or referenda, but by demonstrations, by the media. What I’m sketching is a multidimensional democracy, of which elections are only one part. You need lots of networks, ways of proposing things, ways of challenging things, to-ing and fro-ing, interacting\n\nI would at this point like to make clear my objection to referenda. In particular, I think it was a great abuse to have an up-down referendum on the membership of the EU. Many people had made plans for their whole lives, even acquiring a certain education (learning a language, for instance), on the assumption they would belong to this larger European bloc. It meant that those people represented an important group who were deeply invested in an arrangement that appeared pretty unshakeable. Now I don’t say that people can’t leave a treaty like that, but the decision to pull out of an arrangement of this order should not be made on the basis of what amounted to tossing a coin. We all know that referenda like that are likely to be influenced by collateral sorts of factors that are not germane to the question at issue, namely EU membership. A decision that is going to undermine the lives of a whole sector of the population should not be made on the basis of a one-off, up-down referendum. There are lots of ways it could have been done. One very simple one is to insist on a majority of 60 per cent or over, or to require two referenda, the second incorporating responses to the first.\n\nIn the 18th century, which was the great republican century, people designed constitutions so as to avoid these kinds of decisions. Even Rousseau argued that when making an up-down decision of this kind, the decision-making process must be slowed down somehow. The model for all those drawing up constitutions during the 18th century was, of course, Britain’s. But, ironically, because the British constution was never itself written down, procedures were never introduced for making major infrastructural changes, which is what leaving the EU amounts to. So now there’s this tendency to say, let’s have a referendum, let the people speak. Which is a rubbish understanding of democracy.\n\nreview: The EU isn’t exactly a shining embodiment of democracy…\n\nPettit: I wasn’t saying for one moment that the EU was the perfect democracy. It’s very imperfect indeed, because it’s not clear whether it’s a federation of states acting as states, or a federation of peoples who belong as much to the EU as to their own state. The EU’s a bit of a mess, and the Eurozone was a terrible idea. So I’m very critical of the EU in lots of ways.\n\nDemocracy, from day to day, is a hurly burly, messy business, with people shouting at one another\n\nI’m going to sound like a hoary old conservative now, but democracy only works really well in the longer term. Slow democracy rather than fast democracy. And I think referenda are examples of fast democracy.\n\nDemocracy, from day to day, is a hurly burly, messy business, with people shouting at one another. Rome was like that, too. Cicero talks of the ‘tumult of the crowd’, of their irrepressibility and so on. But Machiavelli was right: that was what was good about Rome, the fact that there was all this tumult and hurly burly. That is what kept the government on their toes.\n\nBut it’s what happens over the longer term that tells us whether democracy is in a good way, whether ideas gain traction among the people, as has happened in many democracies – ideas of equality, of health-provision entitlement, judicious security, social security… All of these ideas have emerged and stabilised only as a result of the hurly burly of day-to-day democracy over the longer term. The success of democracy lies in the laying down of foundations, the establishment of ideas according to which governments cannot be tyrannical or despotic.\n\nPhilip Pettit is LS Rockefeller professor of politics and human values at Princeton University.

1390	Crime fiction: a moral rebellion		http://www.spiked-online.com/detective_fiction.jpg	http://www.spiked-online.com/spiked-review/article/the-moral-case-for-crime-fiction/\n19859\n	\N	The English crime writer Dorothy L Sayers gave a lecture in Oxford in 1935, called ‘Aristotle on Detective Fiction’.\nThat two-way tension between rule-bound behaviour and moral righteousness is dramatically rich, even if it has more to do with character than plot.\nBut my second, the detective, is less concerned about people rising above the law than about the law imploding from within.\nThe rebel leaders are flawed, there are fifth columnists, and the rebellion never finally succeeds or fails.\nThat’s why crime fiction continues to beguile, even when it loses the plot.	And that brings us to the second objection to Chesterton’s defence of detective stories. Does the satisfaction of a mystery solved really have anything to do with morality? Or is it more aesthetic: the pleasing sense of everything coming together in the end, unlike in real life? Indeed, might neatly tied ends actually militate against the realism of a Chandler, who, even if unwittingly, reflected the reality that many murders remain unsolved? Perhaps the real ‘romance of the police force’ would be better dramatised without the aesthetic embellishment of mysteries solved, which, after all, rarely satisfies more than once.\n\nThen again, perhaps a writer who disdains the solving of mysteries has no business writing detective stories. The English crime writer Dorothy L Sayers gave a lecture in Oxford in 1935, called ‘Aristotle on Detective Fiction’. There she entertainingly applied the lessons of Aristotle’s Poetics to the detective story, taking it to be the contemporary form of classical tragedy (1). This was necessary because ‘today, we get many examples exhibiting a rather slender plot and a good deal of morbid psychology’ (reading this, the author of That Existential Leap shifts uncomfortably in his seat).\n\nChannelling Aristotle, Sayers insisted that plot must take precedence over character, and that plot developments should occur unexpectedly, but also in consequence of one another. The trick is to use paralogism – aka leading the reader up the garden path – so that readers are seduced by the wrong conclusions, even when the correct ones are in plain sight. As a result: ‘Even though at the end we are to feel surprise on discovering the identity of the criminal, we ought not to feel incredulity; we should rather be able to say to ourselves: “Yes, I can see now that from the beginning this man had it in him to commit murder, had I only had the wits to interpret the indications furnished by the author.”’\n\nI can’t help but wonder what Sayers (or Aristotle) would have made of the BBC crime drama Line of Duty, which recently finished its fourth series. Line of Duty combines compelling characters with internally coherent but wildly improbable plots, and straddles Deb’s British and American styles by focusing on a closed system of suspects, while gradually revealing a wider plot involving sinister unseen characters.\n\nFor me, the appeal is less in the tortuous plots than in the characters themselves. The main protagonists are not merely detectives, but anti-corruption detectives. Their suspects are fellow police officers. In most police dramas, especially American ones, the ‘rat squad’ is universally despised. It’s almost paradoxical: why should the police object to being policed? But it’s not quite a paradox, because the point is that as people committed to protecting the public, to being the good guys, cops tend to see themselves as a special case. It’s not that they don’t think seriously corrupt officers should be punished; it’s that they feel decent cops should be given the benefit of the doubt to get on with their jobs without undue interference.\n\nThe modern detective’s appeal often has more to do with his or her flaws than any particular virtue or integrity\n\nIntellectually, we can all see that won’t wash. There have to be rules and officers have to be accountable to them. But anti-corruption officers like the ones portrayed in Line of Duty have to embody that principle in a working culture defined by an us-and-them mentality. Having broken the informal rules of group loyalty, they have little choice but to revel in unpopularity, sacrificing the respect of their colleagues for the sake of Chesterton’s ‘most dark and daring of conspiracies’ – doing the right thing.\n\nThat two-way tension between rule-bound behaviour and moral righteousness is dramatically rich, even if it has more to do with character than plot. Superheroes are not bound by rules, after all. And even mere mortals sometimes think of ourselves as special cases. One major influence on That Existential Leap was Dostoevsky’s Crime and Punishment. The protagonist Raskolnikov decides he is an ‘extraordinary person’ and therefore has a kind of special licence to rise above the law and conventional morality, and even commit murder in pursuance of his own greatness\n\nThis idea appeals to my own first, criminal, protagonist. But my second, the detective, is less concerned about people rising above the law than about the law imploding from within. After a particularly sinister child murder, he is put in charge of a new unit to solve ‘occult crimes’, and soon begins to worry he has been put on a crusade that has nothing to do with criminal justice or morality. What happens, not when individuals refuse to subject themselves to the law, but when the law stops treating individuals as responsible subjects?\n\nThe cosmic conservatives DCI Alexander contends with are not just burglars and footpads, but well-meaning senior colleagues who are more interested in keeping the plot moving along than in anyone’s moral character. There is a good deal of morbid psychology, then, but I like to think some of the romance of man, too.\n\nPerhaps Chesterton was right. Detective stories do present us with a romantic rebellion against lawlessness. But that rebellion is more complicated than who killed the chauffeur. The rebel leaders are flawed, there are fifth columnists, and the rebellion never finally succeeds or fails. That’s why crime fiction continues to beguile, even when it loses the plot.\n\nDolan Cummings is a writer based in London. That Existential Leap: A Crime Story is published by Zero Books.

Then neighbour Steve arrived at her doorstep with the ailing moggy in a box.\n\n(Photo: cascadenews.co.uk)\n\nVet Steve Calveley, who treated the cat at Charter Veterinary Surgery in Newcastle under Lyme, said: "We couldn't believe how he had survived such an incredible experience. He was in intensive care and, after sorting his tail out, we turned our attention to the extensive burns he had suffered.\n\n"This included treating the burns with manuka honey, which contains certain antiseptic properties that helps the healing process.\n\n(Photo: cascadenews.co.uk)\n\n"I also think Ronney's fantastic recovery is in part down to him being a very good-natured cat. He's so laid back, we don't even need to sedate him when we're carrying out procedures. I also think it's down to my brilliant team of veterinary nurses who have been totally dedicated to Ronney's care throughout the process."\n\n(Photo: cascadenews.co.uk)\n\nGrateful owner Katrina, a nurse, who lives with her 20-year-old son Gabriel said: "Ronney was extremely traumatised so I kept him quiet and he had a few sips of water and a tiny bit of tuna and salmon."\n\n"We've had Ronney all his life, since he was born on my living room floor after I rescued his pregnant mum Sassy.\n\n"He's a lovely natured cat and never goes very far. He is a bit of a scaredy-cat and the furthest he ever goes is along the walls of the houses nearby so it was unusual when he went missing.\n\n(Photo: cascadenews.co.uk)\n\n"We knew he wouldn't have gone far and my son Gabriel went out looking for him, while I put up posters and knocked on doors.\n\n"This all happened on a Thursday and, as the days went by, I was getting really worried. The worst bit was not knowing what had happened.\n\n"On the Sunday evening, there was a knock at the door and it was a gentleman who lives next door but one. He had Ronney in a toy box and said, 'I think I've got your cat.' I couldn't believe it, particularly when I found out how far Ronney had travelled - on a hot engine! I was so grateful I bought him wine and chocolates."\n\n(Photo: cascadenews.co.uk)\n\nVet Steve, whose Charter Veterinary Surgery is part of the independently-owned Willows Veterinary Group said: "Ronney has become something of a celeb here, everyone loves him. They say cats have nine lives but I think in Ronney's case it's more like 12."\n\nVets found first degree burns which had gone through his skin to muscle underneath.\n\nSteve hopes that Ronney can return home in three to four weeks, while in the meantime, owner Katrina visits him on her days off. "I visit Ronney around three times a week and am really looking forward to having him home permanently," she added.	2017-06-26 11:43:56.820467+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	18	920	['John Jeffay', 'Photo', 'Cascadenews.Co.Uk']

They intend to do likewise this time around.\n\n(Photo: Liverpool FC)\n\nCurrently, the only deal in place is Andre Wisdom’s switch to Derby County for £2million up front rising to £4.5million.However, there has been sufficient interest in other more valuable assets to fuel the belief that proceeds from sales could even pass the £100million mark this summer.\n\nHere are 10 players who could follow Wisdom out of the exit door.\n\nMamadou Sakho\n\n(Photo: David Price)\n\nLiverpool want £30million for the France international, who has no future at Anfield following the breakdown in his relationship with Klopp.\n\nSakho revived his career with a successful loan spell at Crystal Palace in the second half of last season as he spearheaded their push for Premier League survival.\n\nPalace want him back but won’t pay £30million. The 27-year-old centre-back ideally wants to move to a Champions League club.\n\nLiverpool insist their valuation is realistic given Sakho’s wealth of experience, the fact he’s under contract until 2020 and the general shortage of high calibre centre-backs in Europe.\n\nDaniel Sturridge\n\n(Photo: Liverpool Echo)\n\nThe future remains uncertain for the England striker.\n\nLiverpool aren’t actively looking to sell him and Sturridge hasn’t said he wants to leave, but the suspicion remains that there could be an option on the table at some stage that suits all parties.\n\nSturridge’s goal-scoring record of 60 goals in 119 appearances is highly impressive.\n\nBut he started just seven league matches and scored just three league goals in 2016/17 – not much of a return for a £150,000 per week frontman.\n\nFor the third successive season he was hampered by injuries but even when fit there were times when he was behind both Roberto Firmino and Divock Origi in the pecking order.\n\nWill Sturridge, who has two years remaining on his contract, want to stick around if he’s not going to be first choice?\n\nPutting a price tag on Sturridge isn’t easy, considering his injury record. In the current market, it’s unlikely that Liverpool would listen to anything below £30million.\n\nLazar Markovic\n\n(Photo: Julian Finney)\n\nThe Serbian winger is definitely for sale and Liverpool want back the £20million they paid Benfica for him three years ago.\n\nThat prospect would have been laughable six months ago as he floundered on loan at Sporting Lisbon, but his career was revived by a temporary spell at Hull City in the second half of last season.\n\nAlthough Markovic couldn’t keep the Tigers up, his reputation was enhanced under Marco Silva.\n\nThe Portuguese coach, who has since moved on to Watford, is keen to take Markovic to Vicarage Road, but the Hornets will have to break their transfer record to land him.\n\nZenit Saint Petersburg are also in the hunt for the 23-year-old.\n\nAlberto Moreno\n\n(Photo: Andrew Powell)\n\nLiverpool have placed a £15million price tag on the erratic Spanish left-back and are confident of banking that figure.\n\nThe Reds rejected an £11million offer from Napoli last week and are now awaiting higher bids.\n\nHis former club Sevilla, AC Milan, Inter Milan and two Premier League clubs have all enquired about the 24-year-old defender.\n\nThe writing was on the wall for Moreno after a season in which he was relegated to bench duty while midfielder James Milner played ahead of him at left-back.\n\nMaking a profit on the £12million the Reds paid Sevilla for Moreno three years ago would represent remarkable business.\n\nKevin Stewart\n\n(Photo: Getty)\n\nLiverpool rejected a number of approaches for the midfielder back in January but will sell for the right price this summer.\n\nSwansea City, West Brom, Brighton, Newcastle and Aston Villa have all expressed interest in the former Tottenham trainee in the past.\n\nStewart, who signed a new five-year deal last November, made the last of his 20 first-team appearances for the Reds against Plymouth back in January and it’s difficult to see him adding to that tally.\n\nThe Reds picked him up for nothing from Spurs in 2014 but intend to command a hefty fee for the work that’s gone into his development.\n\nHe’s valued at £10million.\n\nLucas Leiva\n\n(Photo: Andrew Powell)\n\nThe situation with Lucas is different.\n\nGiven his decade of service and dedication to the cause, it’s less about what Liverpool want for him and more about what’s best for him and his family.\n\nKlopp would have sanctioned his departure to Inter Milan back in January if the player had pushed for it.\n\nThe manager was delighted that the Brazilian stayed put and played an important role in the Reds’ top-four finish.\n\nLucas, who has one year remaining on his contract, must decide whether he’s happy being a squad player at Anfield or whether the time is right to pursue a new challenge.\n\nHe’s currently weighing up his options.\n\nHe’s still only 30 and has plenty more to offer, if he went to another Premier League club Liverpool could expect to get around £5million for him.\n\nIf he wanted to return home to Gremio that fee would be reduced.\n\nJon Flanagan, Cameron Brannagan, Pedro Chirivella and Connor Randall\n\n(Photo: Ian MacNicol / Getty)\n\nThis quartet will return for pre-season looking to impress Klopp but could depart before the window shuts.\n\nFlanagan is bound to attract plenty of interest, despite a season-long loan at Burnley failing to provide the regular first-team football he craved.\n\nThe tough-tackling right-back is still under contract for another two years and is fighting fit after the knee issues that previously hampered him.\n\nThe boyhood Red will be desperate to force his way into Klopp’s plans.\n\nHowever, with Nathaniel Clyne and Trent Alexander-Arnold for competition, the Academy graduate may need to leave in order to advance his career.\n\n(Photo: Nick Taylor/Liverpool FC)\n\nThe same goes for Brannagan and Chirivella.\n\nBrannagan didn’t feature under Klopp last term before spending the second half of the season on loan at Fleetwood, while Chirivella had a stint in Holland with Go Ahead Eagles.\n\nRandall only played 45 minutes of first-team football last season and will be 22 in October.\n\nHe needs senior football rather than another year with the under-23s and it’s hard to see him getting it at Liverpool.	2017-06-26 11:44:09.086184+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	18	925	['James Pearce', 'Photo', 'Getty Images Asiapac', 'Liverpool Fc', 'David Price', 'Liverpool Echo', 'Julian Finney', 'Andrew Powell', 'Getty', 'Ian Macnicol']

With Real Madrid leading the chase, it's unlikely the Gunners will stump up the eye-watering £120m he's valued at.\n\nAs a result, Lyon's goal machine Alexandre Lacazette has stepped forward to be the man most likely to join Arsene Wenger's men - potentially with Olivier Giroud going in the opposite direction.\n\n(Photo: AFP/Getty)\n\nBut who would be the smart choice to be leading the line at the Emirates come the start of the season?\n\nWe've crunched the numbers to see the stats which could well be influencing Wenger's thinking in his pursuit.\n\n(Photo: Reuters)\n\nHandily, since Giroud joined Arsenal in 2012, the two have played exactly the same amount of games (164) giving us a fair comparison of their key stats.\n\nLacazette vs Giroud - win rate since August 2012 52% Lacazette 57% Giroud Opta\n\nThe Arsenal man edges this one, despite Lyon often finishing in the top four like Giroud's current club.\n\nLacazette 0-1 Giroud\n\nLacazette vs Giroud - goals since August 2012 Opta\n\nLacazette is the big, big winner here - notching a whopping 94 goals to Giroud's 69 since 2012. If the Gunners want more goals, Lacazette seems a smart choice.\n\nLacazette 1-1 Giroud\n\nLacazette vs Giroud - assists since August 2012 Opta\n\nGiroud's benefit to the Arsenal team can often be seen in his hold-up play and assist rate, so unsurprisingly he pips Lacazette here, although not by much - Giroud's haul of 23 assists is only better than his counterpart's by four.\n\nLacazette 1-2 Giroud\n\nLacazette vs Giroud - minutes per goal since August 2012 142.7 Lacazette 157.8 Giroud Opta\n\nOwing to his superior return in front of goal, Lacazette nails this - taking an average of 15 minutes less to find the back of the net compared to Giroud.\n\nLacazette 2-2 Giroud\n\nLacazette vs Giroud - total shots since August 2012 Opta\n\nGiroud may have taken more shots (429) than Lacazette (396), but the Lyon man is clearly more efficient at that end of the pitch.\n\nLacazette 3-2 Giroud\n\nLacazette vs Giroud - shooting accuracy since August 2012 Lacazette 58.4% Giroud 48.3% Opta\n\nAnd here's the proof: Lacazette's shooting accuracy is a shade over 10% better than his France teammate's.\n\nLacazette 4-2 Giroud\n\nSo there you have it, Arsenal fans. It's a close run battle, but if you're looking for goals to get yourself back in the top four next season, it may be an idea to freshen things up in the shape of one Alexandre Lacazette.\n\nAt least Giroud wins in the handsome stakes, eh?	2017-06-26 11:44:11.494562+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	18	926	['Jon Moody', 'Photo', 'Reuters', 'Afp Getty']

He paid\n\nthem but they wanted more.\n\n“My husband and his family are very poor, so I have helped them. I gave up everything to join my husband here.\n\n“I sold up in Scotland in order to get the money to get the house built.\n\n“I gave my husband £60,000 and bought him the bus in 2015 for £31,000.\n\n“I paid for our house to be built and it’s still not finished. It never will be finished. It is in his family’s name.\n\n“I never imagined that I would be at my husband’s funeral. I thought that I would die first, seeing as I’m a lot older than him.”\n\nDiane said married life was good until she moved to Sri Lanka permanently.\n\n(Photo: Daily Record)\n\nAmateur pilot deliberately terrifies his girlfriend just before this mid-air proposal\n\nShe claims she became a “prisoner in her own home”, with her husband leaving her alone for days on end, with no money to buy food.\n\nDiane also said she found a marriage certificate at home in Sinhalese showing the marriage of a man her husband’s age to an 18-year-old woman. She could not translate the certificate but she is suspicious it is Priyanjana’s.\n\nShe said: “He was always working and never home.\n\n“The age gap between us was 33 years but he said it didn’t bother him.\n\n"He said age is only a number and it didn’t really bother me either. All my family and friends thought it would be a problem and it was in the end.”\n\nRelated Video:\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nDiane said she has been in contact with the British consulate.\n\nShe wants to find a lawyer who could help her sell the Sri Lanka house and finance her trip back to Scotland to rebuild her life.\n\nShe said: “I don’t want to live here anymore as my husband is gone.\n\n“I can’t sell the house because it isn’t in my name. I’m trying to get in touch with a lawyer to see if there’s anything they can do to get the family to sign it over to me so I can go back to Scotland and start my life over again.\n\n(Photo: Getty)\n\n“His family is poor so will not be able to help me.\n\n“I’m having to get cash on my credit card in order to buy food because I only have a very small pension and am £1000 in debt.\n\n“My life is ruined.

Italy's debt-to-GDP ratio is among the highest in the world at 132.6 percent at the end of 2016, according to EU data.\n\nThough the strategists believe the addition to the debt burden is offset by the end of uncertainty on this issue, they warned there may be more issues surrounding the sector.\n\n"We should recall that this will not be the end of the noise about the banking system affecting the sovereign as there still remain some issues with Banca Cariage as well as some pending issues with Monte di Paschi di Siena," they said in a note.\n\nItaly was also in the news on the political front, its centre-right parties proving the big winners in mayoral elections on Sunday, partial results showed.\n\nThe vote is likely to put pressure on the centre-left government ahead of national elections due in less than a year.\n\nLater on Monday, European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi is due to speak, at a time when investors are looking for clues on when the bank will end its ultra-loose monetary policy stance.\n\nMost high-grade euro zone bond yields were unchanged on Monday, with 10-year German bond yields edging lower to 0.25 percent.\n\nFor Reuters Live Markets blog on European and UK stock markets see reuters://realtime/verb=Open/url=http://emea1.apps.cp.extranet.thomsonreuters.biz/cms/?pageId=livemarkets\n\n(Editing by Ed Osmond)	2017-06-26 11:46:03.983268+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	8	971

The survey found that 82% are worried about the future of the NHS, and three in five said they expect the NHS to get worse in the coming years.\n\nThree quarters of those surveyed said they thought the number of services on offer will be reduced and 83% said they believed that waiting times would increase.\n\nAnd the poll of more than 1,000 English adults found that 43% were dissatisfied with services compared with a third being satisfied.\n\nThe concerns were echoed in a poll of 422 doctors, where 71% said it has become more difficult for patients trying to access NHS care over the past 12 months.\n\nHunt is causing untold suffering to millions of staff and patients alike - RT if you think we all deserve better pic.twitter.com/6WAr23CaGS — NHS Million (@NHSMillion) June 25, 2017\n\nThe poll was issued to mark the start of the union’s annual representative meeting in Bournemouth, where leading medics will debate many issues facing the workforce and the NHS as a whole.\n\nOne of the motions, tabled by the East Midlands Council arm of the union, is a call for GPs to be able to issue so-called “black alerts” to show they have reached maximum safe capacity.\n\nThe motion, tabled by the East Midlands Council arm of the union, says: “This meeting notes the regular declarations of ‘black alert’ by hospitals and demands that a similar reporting system be created for general practice to indicate that maximum safe capacity has been reached.”\n\nAddressing the conference, BMA chairman of council Dr Mark Porter will say: “We have a government trying to keep the health service running on nothing but fumes. A health service at breaking point. Run by ministers who wilfully ignore the pleas of the profession and the impact on patients.\n\nUnder Hunt we spend less on healthcare as a % of GDP than Paraguay, Moldova & Sierra Leone - RT if you think everyone should realise pic.twitter.com/jXqzZJlby7 — NHS Million (@NHSMillion) June 21, 2017\n\n“After years of underinvestment, with a growing, ageing population, and despite the extraordinary dedication of its staff, it is failing too many people, too often.\n\n“It doesn’t have to be this way. It is the result of an explicit political choice. We don’t have to spend less of our GDP than the other leading European economies on health.\n\n“Our government has chosen to do this. If we spent the average - the average, not the most - then patients would see £15bn extra investment in the English NHS within five years. We’re not asking for the world. We’re asking for the average. For a fair chance to create the health service our patients need and deserve.\n\n“Passing the buck is not a solution. Blaming staff is not a solution. Giving the NHS the resources that patients have told us they need – that’s a solution.”	2017-06-26 11:44:40.374828+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	8	942	['Press Association']
1297	HEALTH NOTES: Ten reasons you don't feel like eating		http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/06/24/19/41B640A500000578-0-image-a-8_1498327328223.jpg	http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-4635878/HEALTH-NOTES-Ten-reasons-don-t-feel-like-eating.html#comments	\N	The most common cause for this is dehydration, so increase fluid intake to make up for any lost through sweating.\nAn underactive thyroid – hypothyroidism – leads to loss of appetite, tiredness, sensitivity to cold temperatures and weight gain.\n8 IT’S A BOWEL DISEASEInflammatory bowel diseases, such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease, cause inflammation of the gut.\nIt is often confused with other illnesses that share the same symptoms: fatigue, loss of appetite, muscle weakness and increased thirst.\nWhile hepatitis C is the most common type in the UK, it is usually spread only through blood contact.	One reason you may not feel like eating could be that you are really stressed\n\n1 IT’S TOO DARN HOT\n\nHigh temperatures, such as those seen across the nation last week, can leave some people experiencing loss of appetite. The most common cause for this is dehydration, so increase fluid intake to make up for any lost through sweating.\n\n2 YOU REALLY ARE STRESSED\n\nStress activates the body’s ‘fight-or-flight response’, a cascade of hormones released that raise blood pressure and heart rate, and change the circulation. These hormones also slow down the digestive system.\n\n3 IT’S YOUR THYROID\n\nThe thyroid gland, located in the neck, is responsible for producing hormones that control the metabolism. An underactive thyroid – hypothyroidism – leads to loss of appetite, tiredness, sensitivity to cold temperatures and weight gain.\n\n4 BLAME MEDICATION\n\nA number of prescription drugs can suppress appetite, including some anti-depressants and cancer treatments. If you are on medication and experience significant weight loss, see your doctor.\n\n5 IT’S MORE THAN ‘THE BLUES’\n\nPeople with depression often lose interest in food, so if you have experienced low mood for a longer period of time, as well as having lost your appetite, it is a sign that it may be something more than just being a bit sad. Speak to your GP, or get in touch with a specialist charity such as MIND.\n\n6 YOU ARE ALLERGIC TO GLUTEN\n\nCoeliac disease – an intolerance to gluten, which is a protein found in grains – often leads to diarrhoea, abdominal pain and indigestion, but can also result in a loss of appetite. If you fear you may be intolerant or sensitive, it is worth excluding gluten from your diet for a short period of time to see if the symptoms improve.\n\n7 YOU’VE PICKED UP A PARASITE\n\nGiardiasis is a rare parasite infection of the digestive system which causes cramps, nausea, indigestion, fatigue and loss of appetite. Often first contracted from drinking contaminated water, it can spread from person to person.\n\n8 IT’S A BOWEL DISEASE\n\nInflammatory bowel diseases, such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease, cause inflammation of the gut. Symptoms include stomach cramps, diarrhoea, fatigue, anaemia and loss of appetite. Most sufferers first develop the diseases in early adulthood, and the cause of many is not yet known.\n\n9 NO ADRENALINE\n\nAddison’s disease, also known as hypoadrenalism, is a rare illness that affects the adrenal glands, which are responsible for producing ‘stress’ hormones such as adrenaline. It is often confused with other illnesses that share the same symptoms: fatigue, loss of appetite, muscle weakness and increased thirst. Patients have to take hormone replacements for life.\n\n10 IT COULD BE VIRAL\n\nLoss of appetite is one of the symptoms of hepatitis, a virus infection of the liver, along with abdominal pain, high fever, muscle and joint pain and jaundice. While hepatitis C is the most common type in the UK, it is usually spread only through blood contact. Hepatitis A and E, on the other hand, are spread through consuming contaminated food and drink. They are both more widespread outside Europe.	2017-06-26 11:44:44.320682+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	8	943	['Mail On Sunday Reporter']

When Breanna Blick entered her first pageant last year, the 18-year-old wasn't drawn to the glittering gowns, sparkling tiara or roaring crowd.\n\nShe was thinking about her father Wayne, who had died 12 years before.\n\nBreanna, who won Miss Teen Australia in November, wanted to get on that stage and tell the world about the disease that took her father when she was just six years old.\n\nWayne was 33 when he was diagnosed with bowel cancer. He died three years later, on Father's Day 2006.\n\nBreanna Blick, 18, will compete in Miss Teen International in honour of her father Wayne Blick\n\nWayne (pictured with Breanna) was just 36 years old when he died of bowel cancer. Breanna was six years old at the time and devastated by his death\n\nAlthough Breanna was very young, she told Daily Mail Australia she had a 'fair idea of what was going on' with her truck driver father, who was also a surf lifesaver.\n\nWayne had always been an energetic father, taking Breanna and her sister to Nippers every Sunday morning from their Newcastle home.\n\n'He always tried to get involved in all our activities,' Breanna said. 'He still took us everywhere for us until his illness wouldn't allow him to do that.'\n\nBut as Wayne continued to fight his battle, things were changing. It was getting harder for him to leave his bed.\n\n'He always tried to get up and interact with me and my sister, so we were always having fun,' Breanna said.\n\n'But looking back at photos now, you can see how strained his face was. I can see it in his face that he was really sick.'\n\nBreanna entered the Miss Teen Australia pageant in November in hopes to compete and spread awareness of bowel cancer. She took first place, never before having done a pageant\n\nWhen Wayne died, Breanna was absolutely devastated. She desperately missed the man who used to light up the room with his big personality.\n\nWayne had always been an energetic father, taking Breanna and her sister to Nippers every Sunday morning when they were kids\n\n'I always think how incredible it would be if he was still alive,' she said.\n\nBreanna has always wanted to spread awareness about bowel cancer, and when she saw an ad for Miss Teen Australia on social media she knew she had found a way.\n\nThe recent high school graduate loved that the pageant was 'really based on your charity and platform'.\n\n'I thought that was great, because I was already involved in bowel cancer and I wanted to get involved more and promote it in Australia,' she said.\n\n'I thought if I won I could promote it internationally, and that's exactly what I'm doing.'\n\nIt was that clear goal that Breanna believes helped her nab the crown, despite the fact she had never done a pageant before.\n\n'I was a bit nervous because I'd never done anything like this before, but I was just myself and gave it a go,' she said.\n\nIt is those weekly trips to the beach with the whole family (pictured) that Breanna said she treasures most of her father\n\nBut as Wayne continued to fight his battle, things were changing. It was getting harder for him to leave his bed as he got sicker\n\n'I think the judges could see why I was there, they knew I was there for a purpose.'\n\nBreanna will go to West Virginia next month to compete in the Miss Teen International competition, where she will compete in athletic wear, evening gown and fashion rounds.\n\nIf Breanna makes the top 10, she will be allowed to speak about her platform and will share her story with the world about her father.\n\nBreanna is hoping her story will help spread awareness for bowel cancer and raise money for important research that could help eventually find a cure.\n\nShe is currently trying to raise $20,000 for Bowel Cancer Australia, in part through a GoFundMe campaign.\n\nIf Breanna makes the top 10, she will be allowed to speak about her platform and will share her story with the world about her father\n\nAnd Breanna hopes to motivate people to learn more about bowel cancer and get regularly tested.\n\nBy the time doctors found Wayne's cancer, it had spread from his bowel to his livers and lungs.\n\n'We had never heard much of bowel cancer before, so it was a massive wakeup call for my whole family and everyone my father knew,' Breanna said.\n\n'He was such a healthy man, and all of a sudden he was just sick.'\n\nBreanna said her family members now all get checked for bowel cancer, a habit that saved her cousin when the test detected polyps on their bowels.\n\n'With early detection, bowel cancer is treatable,' she said.\n\n'Hopefully we can find a cure, so that no one has to go through what my family's been through.'	2017-06-26 11:45:09.371449+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	8	951	['Anneta Konstantinides For Daily Mail Australia']

FRESNO, Calif.

Deputies went door to door asking residents to leave after a 15-foot-wide breach opened along the river Friday.\n\nA total of 300 people had to evacuate, and floodwaters have damaged seven structures and 18 RVs in the area east of Kingsburg, the Fresno Bee reported (http://bit.ly/2u3TewA .). Crews are bringing in sandbags to fill the breaches.\n\nThe Kings River began to flood Wednesday about 25 miles (40 kilometers) north of Fresno as temperatures soared, melting snow in the Sierra Nevada and sending it downstream.\n\n"It was like a war zone out here," country club resident Doreen Dalbey told the Bee. "At one point it (the water) got scary high. I thought the whole house would flood. We thought the water was going a different direction but it started making its way to us. I knew when I saw the water filling up a sand trap and how fast it filled up that we were in trouble and we need to run."\n\nIn May, state water managers said California's springtime snowpack was nearly double its normal levels following five years of historic drought, including two of the driest in the state's recorded history..\n\nA flood warning will be in place for the Kings River area until Monday.	2017-06-26 11:45:20.445958+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	8	956	['Associated Press']

The British and Irish Lions play the final midweek game of their New Zealand tour on Tuesday when they face reigning Super Rugby champions the Hurricanes in Wellington.\n\nHere, Press Association Sport looks at five talking points going into the game, and leading towards next Saturday’s second Test against New Zealand.\n\nRival coaches’ comments provide lively backdrop\n\nAll Blacks Brodie Retallick attempts to charge down British and Irish Lions Conor Murray's kick during the first test (Mark Baker/AP)\n\nAll Blacks head coach Steve Hansen reacted angrily to Lions opposite number Warren Gatland’s demand that referees clamp down on New Zealand’s “dangerous” targeting of scrum-half Conor Murray by phoning a radio station to call him “desperate”. All Blacks boss Hansen called Radio Sport directly in a bizarre move to answer Gatland’s call for greater protection of scrum-half Murray. Gatland was frustrated by what he felt were deliberate tactics from the All Blacks, claiming they were diving “blindly” at Murray’s standing leg whenever he launched a box kick in Saturday’s 30-15 defeat to New Zealand. It is an issue likely to rumble on throughout this week.\n\nA final push for second test places\n\nLiam Williams and Elliot Daly set the tone last week, starring in an impressive victory over the Chiefs and then securing first Test starting places as a result. And their achievement should inspire Tuesday’s Lions team. Full-back Jack Nowell, wing George North and lock Courtney Lawes could be the players who make a statement to Lions head coach Warren Gatland this time round as the tourists look to end their midweek schedule with another victory and provide a squad boost ahead of the next All Blacks clash.\n\nHurricanes are capable of giving the Lions the hurry-up\n\nThe Lions have already lost two midweek fixtures on tour, being beaten by the Blues and Highlanders, and the Hurricanes are certainly capable of completing a hat-trick for New Zealand’s Super Rugby teams. Jordie Barrett and Julian Savea both start after being released from All Blacks duty, while 2015 World Cup star Nehe Milner-Skudder is another player ready to test the Lions’ defence. Wellington’s Westpac Stadium is sold out for the first of two visits by the Lions in five days, and the crowd could be in for a thrilling encounter.\n\nLions fans will hope for a backlash\n\nNot only did the Lions lose last weekend’s first Test, they also found themselves heavily outgunned in the physicality stakes by a rampant New Zealand pack. The All Blacks’ dominance undoubtedly left a physical and mental mark on the Lions, and Tuesday’s line-up under the leadership of Ireland captain Rory Best can set about redressing matters by making a statement against the Hurricanes. It might not be a Test match, but the Lions can still go some way towards stating a case before Test series rivalry is resumed.\n\nWestpac stadium does not hold great Lions memories\n\nThat feeling when our clash with @lionsofficial is just around the corner! #HURVBIL 🌪 pic.twitter.com/HKr4BNIRlE — Hurricanes Rugby (@Hurricanesrugby) June 25, 2017\n\nThe last time the Lions visited Wellington’s “Cake Tin,” as the stadium is nicknamed, they were baked to a cinder.

Fly-half Dan Carter scored 33 points, including two tries, while Tana Umaga, Sitiveni Sivivatu and Richie McCaw also touched down as the Lions were mauled beyond recognition. It gave New Zealand a series-clinching victory over the Clive Woodward-coached tourists.	2017-06-26 11:45:25.288023+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	8	958	['Press Association']

MOSCOW, June 26 (Reuters) - Chile's high-octane style of play has made them one of the world's most entertaining teams to watch but coach Juan Antonio Pizzi has admitted that it comes with a price.\n\nPizzi said that such a relentless style involved an enormous physical effort, raising questions as to whether an ageing squad will be able to maintain it at next year's World Cup, should they qualify.\n\nChile press high, try to win possession deep in the opposition's half and, when they have the ball, throw players forward in numbers in a manner which former Spain coach Vicente del Bosque once said was like "facing 11 kamikazes".\n\nThe system was first adopted under the leadership of coach Marcelo Bielsa, who took them to the 2010 World Cup.\n\nIt was continued by Jorge Sampaoli who led them to their first major title, the 2015 Copa America, and now by Pizzi, who took over at the start of last year.\n\nWhen it works, it makes the South American champions an almost irresistible force, as Australia coach Ange Postecoglou commented following Sunday's 1-1 draw in the Confederations Cup.\n\n"The most important thing was not to let Chile dominate the game because when that happens, it's almost impossible to beat them," he said.\n\nBut Pizzi, whose side face Portugal in the semi-finals on Wednesday, acknowledged that it had taken its toll.\n\n"Our style of play is very demanding, the players have to put in a great effort," he said.\n\n"Our opponents know this and they often have a different way of playing (against us), they tend not to take the initiative.\n\n"We always want to win back the ball and this needs a lot of effort and sacrifice," he added.\n\n"There's no doubt that this causes wear and tear and when the games are as close together as they are in this tournament, there is no doubt that the players feel it."\n\nThat could be even more of a concern given Chile's age -- the Confederations Cup squad has an average age of 28.6 -- with several key players, including midfielder Arturo Vidal and defender Gary Medel, already over 30.\n\nOnly two members of the squad are under 23.\n\nIt was clear in the draws against Germany and Australia that Chile began to run out of steam in the second half.\n\nPizzi, however, has made it clear that Chile's style is also what makes them such a competitive team and he is not prepared to change it.\n\n"The team's character and temperament is to always try and create scoring chances," he said before the start of the tournament.

Thee, me, and your father up to no good!’\n\n‘I’ve had my fill of sailing close to the wind,’ muttered Poldark. ‘I have a wife, a child, and another on the way.’\n\nTwo peas in a pod: As for Poldark’s accomplice on the mission ‘Tholly’ was a loud, drunken, rogue with a metal hook for a hand and a face covered by a web of scars worthy of Spider-Man. He looked like one of The Wurzels in fancy dress as a pirate (or vice versa)\n\nVery noble. Strangely he chose not to mention Valentine - the baby Elizabeth had just given birth to, conceived when Master Ross virtually raped her.\n\nWith every French wench in the bar flashing Poldark suggestive glances (and not just glances), he ostentatiously acted natural when they finally met their informant.\n\n‘Most of ze prison-heurs are Een-gleesh,’ whispered the spy. ‘Many are seek and wound-haired.’\n\nPoldark needed a list of prisoners’ names – ingeniously figuring he needed to see Doctor Dwight was alive before attempting to rescue him.\n\n‘For ze right price...’ their contact said with a Gallic shrug, taking off his beret, and lighting a Gitanes. ‘Une hundred.’\n\nSurprisingly un-streetwise, without haggling Poldark handed over his Euros – twice, after their contact came back and made the same demand again.\n\nPutting plan into action: Poldark needed a list of prisoners’ names – ingeniously figuring he needed to see Doctor Dwight was alive before attempting to rescue him\n\n‘Every hour you remain puts you in greateur dangeur,’ he warned Poldark. ‘They will not turn a blind eye to spies.’\n\n‘We are not spies,’ Poldark insisted feebly, not even convincing himself. They certainly weren’t very good ones.\n\nThe combined forces of the police and the army hauled Poldark and Tholly in almost immediately, without great difficulty.\n\nTheir leader saw through Poldark’s story that he was there on business in a second. He informed him simply for failing to report their arrival they could be imprisoned. A second offence was punishable by execution.\n\nPossibly a bit harsh...\n\nDrama: Their leader saw through Poldark’s story that he was there on business in a second. He informed him simply for failing to report their arrival they could be imprisoned. A second offence was punishable by execution\n\nHe was prepared to waive the charges as long as they left France ‘on the next sheep.’\n\nPoldark’s attempt to bribe him, like the rest of his mission, was an embarrassing failure.\n\nOn the boat home, as soon as Tholly praised the way Poldark had been ‘sensible’ we knew he would do something that wasn’t.\n\nSure enough, he handed Tholly his hat and dived overboard, swimming like The Milk Tray Man back to France.\n\nNot just rash but a missed opportunity for Aidan Turner to take his shirt off.\n\nNo chance: Poldark’s attempt to bribe him, like the rest of his mission, was an embarrassing failure\n\nPoldark’s second attempt to spring Dwight proved equally short-lived, escaping arrest by punching his way out of trouble like the Cornish D’Artagnan.\n\nThe next thing we knew he was galloping up to the farm and Demelza, proudly waving the list with Doctor Dwight’s name on that confirmed he was alive but notably without Doctor Dwight himself.\n\nIt never seemed to even cross his mind to ask after his son (Jeremy), his nephew (Geoffrey Charles), his aunt (Agatha) or illegitimate baby (Valentine), let alone wonder how Demelza had coped, as she put it (often) ‘with a farm and the mine to run, a child and a baby on the way.’\n\nHeroine: The next thing we knew he was galloping up to the farm and Demelza, proudly waving the list with Doctor Dwight’s name on that confirmed he was alive but notably without Doctor Dwight himself\n\n‘Sometimes I wonder why I wed him,’ she complained ominously. ‘I promised to love, honour and obey him but why should I?’\n\nInstead he cast his success and survival as a heroic triumph.\n\n‘There were times when I doubted I’d come back alive. If you knew what conditions are like...France is a desperate place.’\n\nClearly not a Remainer...\n\nPoldark had only been back ten minutes before they were having a domestic – about an old, church-shaped, store house she had given her brothers to use as a church.\n\nPersonal life: Poldark had only been back ten minutes before they were having a domestic – about an old, church-shaped, store house she had given her brothers to use as a church\n\n‘Why would you take such a decision without asking me?!’ he demanded, affronted, sounding alarmingly as pompous and sexist as George Warleggan.\n\nWhile Poldark had been off in France playing spies, his nemesis had been making plans to move Elizabeth away to Truro heartlessly abandoning ‘Jeff’.\n\nPoldark’s refusal to become a magistrate had also allowed Warleggan to take up the position and become power-crazed, pardoning the rich and punishing the poor feverishly.\n\nDoctor Dwight meanwhile was still languishing in the prisoner of war camp.\n\n‘Am I dead? Is this hell?’ a fellow soldier begged him.\n\n‘You’re alive my friend,’ diagnosed Doctor Dwight. ‘But you’ll wish that you were not. We’re all in hell now!’\n\nFor his part, Poldark had got over his guilt about all of them and was back in the lap of luxury – or rather of Demelza, who had quickly forgiven him and was putty in his hands once again.\n\nSmitten: For his part, Poldark had got over his guilt about all of them and was back in the lap of luxury – or rather of Demelza, who had quickly forgiven him and was putty in his hands once again\n\n‘No doubt you were plagued by French beauties !’ she suggested tentatively.\n\n‘No doubt I was,’ Poldark preened.\n\n‘No doubt you availed yourself,’ she countered, more pointedly, knowing his history with Elizabeth.\n\n‘No doubt I did,’ he teased again, rather cruelly.\n\nDespite her protests and speeches, whatever he did Demelza rolled over. Literally.\n\n‘Perhaps if you behave well you may be warmer than you deserve!’ she cooed coquettishly.\n\nIn fact, as Poldark lay in bed passionately kissing Demelza he was so warm he had to take his shirt off.\n\n‘Mission accomplished’ as far as he and the viewers were concerned.\n\nDoctor Dwight could wait for now.	2017-06-26 11:45:52.797313+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	8	967	['Jim Shelley For Mailonline']

Read more: What the Tata Steel crisis tells us about Brexit\n\nThere is no doubt about it: the government has been asleep at the wheel in the face of an oncoming crisis. As my Labour parliamentary colleagues Stephen Kinnock, Stephen Doughty and Anna Turley—all of whom represent steel industry communities—have pointed out, it wasn’t as if the government didn’t know that the events of the last few days were a possibility. The Tata Board meeting on 29th March in Mumbai had been in the diary for months. Tata Steel’s board member Koushik Chatterjee underlined this when he told us this week that the company had kept the UK government constantly informed of the realities of the situation.\n\nWhat is at stake? Tata Steel’s UK business employs 15,000 people with a further 25,000 estimated to be employed in its supply chains. Their largest plant is in Port Talbot, South Wales, with around 10,000 direct and indirect jobs at risk. All these jobs could be lost if no buyer is found in the next few days. Of course, it is not only the jobs, but the knock-on impact on UK manufacturing that needs to be considered too.	2017-06-26 23:32:37.238073+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	38	1026

Image Text: TRAGIC:Amy Winehouse highlights the needless suffering of many affected by drugs\n\nREMEMBER THE (fantastically overrated) film American Gangster? The one where Denzel plays a drug baron in the exact persona he played Malcolm X.\n\nAnyway, the end of the movie (in which police storm a drugs factory and kill at will) reminds me of the demise of Amy Winehouse. They’re both drug fuelled, tragic, completely pointless and, to some degree, avoidable.\n\nThe recent sad death of Amy Winehouse will be treated as the isolated death of an immensely talented singer whose decline, if not her death, was fuelled by drugs. Or at best this will become a debate about addiction, which would only be discussing half of the problem.\n\nPOLICY\n\nThe problem is this: there are many Amy Winehouses. Most of them would make rubbish jazz singers. Many of them are not physically dead. However each one is as tragic as the demise of Winehouse herself. The misery of most of these people (as well as their families, loved ones and communities) is not created by drugs, but by drug policy, by the futile laws prohibiting the insatiable demand and supply of drugs.\n\nDrug policy has pointlessly criminalised millions of people, torn families apart, left people in despair and destitution, created dependencies (which are then ruthlessly exploited), boosted the global prison population to a peak and left many dead. But to be fair, drug policy has had its benefits: it has helped sell newspapers, elect politicians, enrich gangsters, provide entertainment fodder and create an environment where those who are affected by it – the users, the sellers or their loved ones – are thought of as lesser than those who are not.\n\n\n\nFILM: Denzel Washington in American Gangster\n\nIf everyone who had used or sold drugs was punished to the full extent of the law many of the most talented people in history would be tainted by convictions or languishing away in prison.\n\nEven Barack Obama would be doing porridge and worrying about dropping soap.\n\nSee how ridiculous it sounds? Yet it is happening. Take the tragic case of Chris Lewis, a former England cricketer. He is 24 months into a 13-year sentence for smuggling cocaine. The average sentence for rape on the other hand is eight years. This is the definition of lunacy!\n\nFUTILE\n\nCountless professors, experts, government advisers, etc have all highlighted the futility of international drug policy. In fact the odds are you’ve read this article in some form or fashion a hundred times. And they all say the same thing: we have a manmade disaster on our hands in the form of drug policy. What can we do about it?\n\nIf the tabloids really wanted to do the nation a self-redeeming favour they’d seize the moment and start a campaign in memory of Amy Winehouse called Amy’s Law.\n\nCAMPAIGN\n\nAmy’s Law would not technically be a law, but a demand that drug laws be relaxed. And Amy’s Law would demand that a much more common sense approach to drugs enforcement be implemented, such as the legalisation of narcotics, taxing the profits from them, regulating the quality of drugs available and better treatment for addicts. In short, adopt the policy that is used for the vicious drug called alcohol.\n\nSurely this has to be better than the current policy which involves ostracising people.\n\nIf animals can inspire people to create successful campaigns to ensure that they not be held in cages and forced into the circus, aren’t some of the more vulnerable and drug addicted human beings worthy of a campaign too?\n\nWe must do a lot better than make a spectacle out of addicts.\n\nThey’re human beings after all.	2017-06-26 23:30:52.751529+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	41	996

So much so that the golfer Bubba Watson has promised to paint over the symbol which is emblazoned on the roof of the car from the TV series Dukes of Hazzard, a vehicle which he now owns.

They showed us the way. They laid their lives on the line and are still doing so. Anywhere in the United States where racism is endemic - corporate and institutional - you will see African Americans fighting the good fight on all our behalf.\n\nBut until they change the narrative of American history and force their media and lawmakers to describe their forefathers and foremothers as ‘enslaved’ rather than ‘slaves’ they will always be regarded as slave babies.	2017-06-26 23:30:55.803692+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	41	998

Image Text: INSTRUMENTAL ROLE: The late Sam King\n\nON JUNE 17, Black Britain lost a community giant, Jamaica-born Sam King.\n\nHe was a key figure of the Windrush Generation; that group of West Indians who arrived in England between the 1940s and 60s to find work, fulfil their ambitions and to make their mark on the world.\n\nHis life highlights the importance of faith, being proud of and celebrating black culture and the need for people of colour to engage in civic society.\n\nKing, who died aged 90, was a resident of Southwark in south London for much of his life in Britain and attained a number of historic achievements.\n\nIn 1958 he co-founded a West Indian carnival that many believe laid the foundations for the Notting Hill Carnival, an event that has become the biggest street party in Europe, attracting up to 1 million people every August Bank Holiday.\n\nHe was active in politics, and in 1983 became the first black man to be appointed Mayor of the London borough of Southwark.\n\nBlack historian, Arthur Torrington worked with Sam for over 30 years and shared that he was relentlessly positive, and felt it was important for the black community to always look for ways to solve the various problems it faced, even the current ones of youth crime and violence. Sam talked from experience.\n\nDuring the 1980s, when there was social unrest amongst second generation black youth, partly because of the racism and prejudice they experienced, Sam’s response was to join forces with councillor Aubyn Graham to set up a youth club.\n\nOne young person who regularly attended the club was Rio Ferdinand. He went on to play for Manchester United, captained the England team and is currently a TV pundit at the Euro 2016 football championships being held in France.\n\nWhat is little touched upon is the important role Christian faith played in Sam’s life. Torrington, told Soul Stirrings: “He died a very strong Christian. He had a deep faith that saw him through all the pain he felt when he was passing.”\n\nSam attended the First of the Church Born in Brixton, and had been a lay preacher, having taken a ministerial course at Goldsmith College in Lewisham, south east London.\n\nFew people are also aware that he played an instrumental role in widening the appeal of UK gospel.\n\nDuring his tenure as mayor, Sam organised a major service at Southwark Cathedral featuring a number of the leading choirs of the time including the London Community Gospel Choir, the Inspirational Choir and COGIC Mass Choir.\n\nThe service was filmed by the BBC and broadcast as part of a groundbreaking Songs of Praise programme. In the process it highlighted the music being performed in Britain’s burgeoning black church community to a wider audience.\n\nSam was awarded an MBE for his community service.\n\nHe lived a long, impacting and fruitful life, and if more of us followed his example in serving our community, wider society and the church and responded practically and if we realistically to societal problems, our community would not only thrive, it would soar.	2017-06-26 23:30:58.539562+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	41	1000

Image Text: SONGS OF PRAISE: But do single Christians have much to feel joyful about?\n\nROBED IN my new scarlet body-con dress, looking uber-regal and radiant (even if I do say so myself) I’m set for the summer concert and convention season with talks, workshops, business breakfasts, single-mixers aplenty ready to, per chance, make new acquaintances amidst the heady heights of corporate worship with new faces. Then, the big one - the inevitable main-speakers’ tumultuous, thunderous “Go and Grow to the end of the age, have-I-not-sent-you” finale to leave me feeling completely full of conviction and ready for the mission fields of sunny Birmingham. Oh really? Who am I kidding, really?\n\nWhether it’s the Jabula Conference, The Israel Houghton Concert, The New Testament National Convention, The Midnight Oil Summit or The Winans Tribute night, the story ends the same – me, myself and I getting with on with life on planet Me, Myself and I. Yes, Beyonce, I am Miss Independent, but for many of us independence is synonymous with swimming and not sinking in life rather than a designer label existence. Last year and indeed every year, prior, I bought my own tickets, drove my own car to the events, praised and worshipped with my brothers and sisters in wonderful atmospheres of corporate anointing, prayed and blubbed healing tears with the intercessors, supped cups of tea afterwards in the canteens and then drove my own sorry, lonely beautiful self back home to praise God for another day of life in my upbeat, trendy apartment for one.\n\nYes, it is upon us – that time when we hope for the Summer of Love which invariably holds much promise if only for a moment, as we hear of our “big-people” friends getting hitched to so-and-so. We survived our birthday with a few trusted well-wishing friends or family who always send a card or will go for the obligatory drink. We dealt with Christmas and the mistletoe digs. We trumpeted the “Valentine’s-Day-is-just-a-commercialised-pagan-festival-anyway” speech for anyone who dared ask. We spent the Easter Bank Holiday again, with the trusted well-wishing friends, and the movie looks set to continue thus, until we can meet the beau or belle we so deeply need to break the monotony on planet Me, Myself and I that I have grown tired of praying and/or talking about.\n\nREFLECT\n\nIt’s official – the church is failing single people according to research conducted by the Christian Connection dating website which analysed the responses of its users. The survey found that over a third of Christians who are not married, said that they felt they are not treated as those who are part of family; that nearly four out of 10 single churchgoers said that they often felt “inadequate or ignored”, while 42.8 percent felt that their “church did not know what to do with them”; and a total of 37 percent said that “they did not feel treated as family members.” Although many of us find it hard to meet a godly suitor, most of us will still insist on marrying a Christian. Churches are simply not learning how to reflect the changes to the modern world in accommodating or even remotely recognising the needs of it’s single members.\n\nDon’t even get me started on the marginalisation of single women in the churches! Let’s face it - outside of joining the choir and/or volunteering to serve in a “ministry” of sorts, church leaders are at a loss as to how to support those of us aged 30 upwards. To be fair to them however, they are often struck with ever-decreasing numbers of strong-conviction male Christians who feel confident in developing relationships with women. Indeed, my experiences include liaisons with the following:-\n\nThe Harem Wrangler – Married on average, for around 20 years, with 2.4 kids, he loves his wife but has a string of female, “friends” none of whom he has a sexual relationship with, but some of whom he is sometimes strongly emotionally connected to, often enjoying a better friendship with some of these women than he does his wife.\n\nThe Prophet of Doom – Bible-toting, Hawaii Five-O-style Christian male full of conviction as he roams the streets, buses and train stations preaching the Word in and out of season, because he’s married to The Ministry. The Apostle Paul being his hero, he fiercely guards his heart from the merest hint of forming a relationship, as he is sure he has no need of women. He is here to herald that women are the ultimate deceiver, cunning and wily.\n\nThere are of course, many other “types” but you get the picture – the panoramic view does not bode well for single Christians (particularly women) wanting to meet other single Christians not necessarily via dating websites or via other social networking media but within Christian circles - at minor, everyday or major events. This is, by far, the most underrated trial in the church, with single Christian women comprising a vast majority of most congregations.\n\nAny church leader brimming with vision and passion for a new inner city church planting would not neglect the plans to provide a car park knowing that over 50% of the intended churchgoers are car drivers. Why then, are the needs of so many who are increasingly forming the majority grouping in our churches so marginalised? The way forward? It’s time this issue is raised and revisited on a regular basis from the pulpit at least (and not confined to one-off single’s events.)\n\nLet’s at least start there church leaders.\n\nJacqueline Ffrench is a lecturer in law based in Birmingham. She taught within the Further Education sector before moving on to work in Higher Education. She is a committed Christian who enjoys living life as God intended.	2017-06-26 23:31:14.482342+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	41	1003

But I had the nieces and nephews round and they love the show and so, like any caring, loving parent or guardian, they can watch whatever they like so long as I can have some peace and quiet.\n\nSo we settled down to watch it and I contemplated closing my eyes for a 10-minute power nap. The usual nonsense came on and I was glad that they seemed to enjoy what I thought was nonsense. Then Zipparah Tafari, a man I had worked with in Manchester years before appeared.\n\nI knew him as Mr. Zip and he specialized in working with children. Gosh I thought; 'What is he going to do?'. Then he started to sing and I wanted to hide. It was such foolishness, this Where me keys, where me phone? song.\n\nThen I noticed the children and they were not embarrassed, they were singing, they were dancing. They loved it. Mr. Zip had smashed the proverbial ball out of the park. Where me keys, where me phone? We laughed, we laughed and then we ALL did the dance.\n\nYou could see that Simon didn’t know what to make of it at first but it is so catchy and so stupid that you just had to go with it I predict a huge hit and dance to go with it.\n\nI have no ides what he is going to do now he is thru to the next round but who cares. I was glad to see someone I know doing his thing.

How will we even recognise it when it happens? How do we know if it has already begun?\n\nA simple Google search of the meaning of the word brings up an easily recognisable definition:\n\n1) an improvement in the condition, strength or fortunes of someone or something.\n\n2) an instance of something becoming popular, active, or important again.”\n\nThe key word in the given definition is the last word… ‘again’.\n\nFirst and foremost, we have to remember in order for something to be revived it must first have lived.\n\nYou can’t revive something that has never existed.\n\nSo as we’re praying for revival in our cities and in our churches, we must be able to answer the simplest of questions…\n\n\n\nWhat exactly are we asking God to restore and to bring back to life?\n\nJohn 1: 1 says, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.”\n\nCould it be that as we’re praying and thanking God for revival that we’re actually praying that the Word – that was here from the very beginning – is revived in us again?\n\nThat we are brought into a relationship with the Word, who hung on the Cross so that we might have life? That the Word will once again be recognised as God Himself and worshipped and honoured as such?\n\nFrom the ‘Age of Enlightenment’ in 18th Century Britain. which crossed the waters for the American colonies to experience the ‘Great Awakening’, our history is spattered with periods of fantastic revivals that took place. These include God using the likes of George Whitefield, John Wesley and Charles Spurgeon to name but a few.\n\nAnd these weren’t just small adhoc events where a few would feel the stirrings of the move of God. These were revivals that changed the course of entire nations.\n\nBut preceding these revivals, there was something that was very evident in both the Church and the societies - a lack of Godliness and a lack of hunger for Him.\n\nBefore any great revival, there would first come a turning away of Godliness and Christian values, where only the flesh was indulged and in most cases, over indulged.\n\nWasn’t it during the Great Awakening that the rampant and extremely profitable slave trade was abolished?\n\nWhen God moves then people move! And that’s when we begin to see real change but not just within our churches but the change happens in our governments, in our educational systems, in our social structures.\n\nWhen God moves, the sick are not only healed but more medical discoveries are opened up to us.\n\nWhen God moves, the poor are not only saved but they are fed. If we want to see change in our Nations – in how things are run – in how people are treated, then we need to see a true revival – a returning of people’s hearts to the Word.\n\nBRITAIN ARISE FOR REVIVAL, a bi-monthly event led by Pastor Sam Adetona, aims to bring about the radical reform needed in order for the Church to permeate the promised revival that will invoke God’s blessings upon Great Britain.\n\nThe first event was held on Saturday, January 16, 2016 at Regents Hall, 275 Oxford Street, London W1C 2DJ (Next door to JD Sports and just a two minutes walk from Oxford Circus Tube Station)\n\nFor upcoming dates on the campaign, please visit www.britainarise.com	2017-06-26 23:31:31.90572+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	41	1008

"A lot of things that so-called Muslims are doing have nothing to do with the teaching of the religion."\n\nHe conceded that the unfortunate labelling of innocent individuals breeds resentment.\n\nAnother reason that Muhammad says people gravitate towards Islam is because they are turned off from the Christian faith.\n\n"We have been taught to have respect for other religions and don't encourage people to cry down or be critical, so I would say 'have you ever sat with the pastor or people who are more knowledgeable in your faith?'" he said.	2017-06-26 23:31:33.260212+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	41	1009

Although I wish they would call it what it is - RACISM. But now they have told the world about it, they need to agitate, educate, organise - because that’s the only way black students are going to rise above the crap that they have to deal with.\n\nI know what I’m talking about. I was a student agitator/organiser. I was the president of my union at university. I fought tirelessly for the rights of all students, but stood up firm against the prejudice black and Asian students faced. It wasn’t just prejudice from fellow students who are sometimes so ignorant it begs the question how they got to university in the first place. Black students also have to deal with the patronising attitude towards them by lecturers who shouldn’t be in those positions of authority with their prejudices.\n\nUNCOMFORTABLE\n\nNot only that, we find that when we leave the safety and strength in numbers of London to go and study in some backwater up country like Keele or Exeter, we have to deal with hostility from a tiny minority of locals.\n\nHaving said all this, none of it should sway you against going to university. We’ve all had to deal with an element of prejudice on our route to that BA/BSc. Education is a must. It’s just that you have to stand up strong when you go to get yours.\n\nThere used to be an organisation called the Black Students’ Alliance which did what it says on the tin.

You’ve bucked the stereotypes. You kept going and crossed the finishing line. You ground out those GCSEs, conquered your A-Levels and annihilated your degree. You are now what they (i.e. your family) call a ‘success’ and wider society calls ‘educated’.\n\nAssuming you’re black and British, you’re now an educated black Briton (EBB). Congratulations.\n\nBut what does it mean to be an EBB? What do EBBs like? Of course it will vary from EBB to EBB but I’ve set out on a light-hearted course to find some of the common themes.\n\nBefore we proceed a disclosure must be made: I recently had the pleasure of reading an article titled ‘Things Educated Black People Like’. The article was very American-centric (as most things are) so I was inspired to write a British specific version. In short: I give credit where credit is due, my ideas are my own and I certainly ain’t trying to go out like Jason Blair or Johann Hari!\n\nWithout further ado (in no particular order): Things Educated Black Britons Like.\n\nThe Guardian: Perhaps as much an authority on black issues as any paper in the mainstream is willing to be. For EBBs reading the Guardian is now as much a statement of being black, educated, upwardly mobile, and uppity as it is a source of information.\n\nQuestion Time: Weekly shout-at-the-TV-session whilst whatsapping friends wondering how Bonnie Greer, an African American, became our only in-demand non-political EBB.\n\nBlack history: Having a formal education is one thing, knowing who you are and who your forebears were is just as critical, if not more so.\n\nPrestige German cars: If it’s not an Audi, a BMW, a Mercedes or, at worst, a Volkswagen no self-respecting EBB will drive it.\n\nJapanese food: Whether it be Katsu Curry or the ‘full Sushi’, nothing speaks sophisticated black person like knowing how to use chop-sticks.\n\nTheir countries of origin (and Ghana): When you arrive on campus and mix with other black people you immediately learn two things: firstly, your cultural identity is critical. Secondly, Nigerians are everywhere. By the time they graduate many EBBs find themselves very in touch with and appreciative of their countries of origin and quite hostile to ultra-judgemental-know-it-all-Nigerians. As a result you’re pushed into the open arms of Ghana.\n\nDistance running: EBBs appreciate a well-trained body as much as they do a well-trained mind.\n\nAuthentic black British theatre with after show discussions: This is a chance to enjoy seeing your stories on stage and then to critique them (i.e. show off your education) afterwards. Bola Agbaje and Ade Solanke reign supreme in this space.\n\nHaving a good time without excessive drinking or taking drugs: Just not what we do. EBBs will tell you fun is only fun if you know what you’re doing.\n\nTravelling: It is another aspect of education.\n\nTalking about their ‘political aspirations’: Most EBBs will do little more than talk. The few that do act on their ‘Audacity of Hope’ usually call it a day the moment they are handed a thousand leaflets and told to go door to door delivering them and campaigning on a cold Saturday afternoon.\n\nFlirting with the Tory party: “I stand a better chance of becoming an MP in the Tory party as Labour is full of EBBs…”. Common-sense normally kicks in when Norman Tebbit subjects you to one of his notorious acid tests by vehemently demanding that you become the party’s face of anti-immigration. Shout out to Shaun Bailey.\n\nChuka Ummuna: The EBBs’ EBB. He is one of us.\n\nAward shows: Glitz, glamour and celebrity. Like anyone else EBBs love having their efforts widely acknowledged. Although you may not have heard of them there are quite a lot of black awarding bodies (many of them have web- based voting systems) out there: BEEFTA, GUBA, MOBO, BCA, BYA, BRA, LSBCA, BMA, BIFA, NDA, BAMA. Etc.\n\nPublically correcting people: Is there any point in getting an education if you can’t use it to put the less educated in their place?\n\nDebating: If EBBs other than Bonnie Greer (who is far too American to qualify) were allowed on Question Time it would be a much richer show. EBBs love a good vitriolic argument, are usually impeccably informed and rise to the occasion.\n\nMalcolm X: As professional life takes its toll and you’re passed over for that very deserving promotion and discover that you’re paid less than your peers, the teachings of Brother Malcolm become increasingly appealing. Sod forgiveness.\n\nPentecostal churches: Religion, rave and networking all rolled into one. Perhaps the only British institution truly dominated by EBBs.\n\nWhite people: ‘Some of our best friends are white’. It has the added benefit of being very true.\n\nLazy list articles about themselves: Enough said.	2017-06-26 23:31:48.441885+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	41	1013

EASTER IS the biggest event in the Christian calendar. Millions of Christians throughout the world will be gathering this weekend to remember and celebrate the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.\n\nFor many believers, Jesus’ act of dying on the cross as a living sacrifice for humanity’s sins so that they could enjoy a relationship with God is not only worth celebrating, but also worth suffering for.\n\nSo whilst many Christians in the Western world are able to live out their faith in relative freedom and peace, there are Christians in countries such as India, Pakistan, Syria and others who are persecuted and sometimes killed for their faith.\n\nThat’s why it pains me when I hear church leaders preach messages that are more a re-telling and spiritual affirmation of the American dream and the insights you can gain from reading self-help books, as opposed to the true essence of Christianity.\n\nJesus didn’t die so that Christians could become millionaires, get the best jobs or cars, be the most popular person at school/church or work or live out their dreams, (even though these things can be the by-product of living a Christian life).\n\nJesus died so that we could be in relationship with God, gain forgiveness of sins, and experience the things success, fame and riches don’t and can’t provide such as peace, contentment, a sense of purpose, life transformation and the ability to forgive and love ourselves, and our fellow human beings.\n\nChristianity in essence deals with the spiritual nature of individuals. It’s concerned with people being in the right relationship with God and allowing his spirit to work in them, to transform their character, behaviour and reason for living.\n\nThat’s why when you attend a church service, and are lucky enough to hear people share stories of how and why they became Christians, they’ll give accounts of total life transformation.\n\nOver the years I’ve been blessed to interview numerous people from wide ranging backgrounds who’ve shared that becoming a Christian has helped them give up a whole range of negative behaviours and attitudes such as criminality, promiscuity, lying, cheating, stealing, maliciousness, unforgiveness… the list could go on.\n\nAnd that’s why, with Easter approaching we must see this special and unique time of the year for what it is – which is a small window in time to reflect on the history changing moment Jesus Christ died for the sins of humanity so that they could enjoy a life enriching relationship with their Heavenly Father.\n\nAnyone who tells you anything different has got it all wrong.	2017-06-26 23:31:57.519568+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	41	1015

Image Text: CHURCH: Women give praise\n\nI HAVE been reading with interest about a fascinating Washington Post/Kaiser Family Foundation poll of the views and experiences of black women, entitled Black Women in America.\n\nA Washington Post article looked at the findings of the study, which surveyed 800 black women to discover their attitudes towards issues such as work, education, how they are perceived in the media, religion and marriage.\n\nAmong the numerous findings the study revealed is that religion is more important in black women’s lives than finding love. Almost 50 percent worry about being discriminated against, 85 percent say that they are satisfied with their lives, 20 percent say that being wealthy is important to them – compared to 5 percent of white women – and 67 percent described themselves as having high esteem.\n\nRESONATE\n\nAlthough the study is focused on African-American women, the findings will resonate with black women everywhere, because black Americans like Oprah Winfrey, Michelle Obama, Serita Jakes, Cece Winans, Queen Latifah, and Yolanda Adams provide a vision to black women throughout the Diaspora of what can be achieved through faith in God, ambition and hard work.\n\nMost of the findings did not surprise me. For instance, 20 percent of those surveyed stated being wealthy is important to them, compared to 5 percent of white women. If you are bringing up a family on your own, or have many people depending on you for financial support, the amount you earn and the wealth you can accrue takes on particular importance.\n\nNeither was I surprised by the fact that the majority of the women surveyed reported that they were satisfied with their lives and have high self-esteem. Black women have risen above the negative media and societal stereotypes that exist about them, and see themselves as capable, talented people who are achievers able to make a valuable contribution to society. There is no doubt that this feeling of worth and contentment is linked to having a strong belief in God.\n\nThe survey found that living a religious life was very important to 74 percent of black women, and somewhat important to 18 percent.\n\nWhat did initially come as a surprise was the fact that a minority of the black women surveyed (albeit a large one) – 40 percent – felt marriage was important.\n\nOne woman quoted in the Washington Post article stated: “I can go to school. I can be successful. I can make money. I can have a career. That is in my power to control. Finding a husband – that would be great, but that’s not in my power to control.”\n\nWhilst there will always be single Christian women who are happy as they are, the majority of single black women I’ve encountered on my life’s journey, young and old, those with children and those without, want to get married. I’ve known women with life-threatening illnesses, with death not too far away, still believing that God will help them to find a partner.\n\nCONTENTION\n\nBlack relationships have become a major area of contention, and because it is the one area of our lives over which we have no control people are giving up on it. This is sad.\n\nWhat does come out loud and clear from the report is that black women have a strong faith, are confident and ambitious and will continue to push the envelope no matter what life throws at them. And with God on our side, we have realised we can achieve and be anything.	2017-06-26 23:31:58.596827+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	41	1016

1370	How black parents can beat UK’s university system and win		http://www.voice-online.co.uk/sites/default/files/voice_logo.png	http://www.voice-online.co.uk/article/how-black-parents-can-beat-uk%E2%80%99s-university-system-and-win	\N	TO KNOW the system is to, hopefully, beat the system.\nThe university being advertised wouldn’t, by any stretch of the imagination, be described as a “good university”.\nIt is what I see as a pipeline university for poor and minority ethnic children: for people who don’t know the system.\nWhen you speak to young black people either university bound or in university, the names of the same set of institutions pop up.\nThe reality of attending these intuitions is that graduates will struggle to compete with their peers, fuelling the black unemployment crisis.	TO KNOW the system is to, hopefully, beat the system. Sadly, for many black people, time and again the system beats us. Perhaps we don’t have a clue what that system is.\n\nCase in point: I recently attended a wonderful event in north London. Everything from music to journalism, science to skillful speech was on offer. It was a rich learning experience and I left a lot richer than when I walked in. But something left a sour taste in my mouth which had nothing to do with the event itself.\n\nIt had been held at a sixth form college with a high African and Caribbean student base. While there, I noticed two large posters – framed and prominently positioned – for a particular university. My heart sank.\n\nThe university being advertised wouldn’t, by any stretch of the imagination, be described as a “good university”. Of the 120 or so higher learning institutions in the United Kingdom, it currently languishes in the nineties.\n\nIt is what I see as a pipeline university for poor and minority ethnic children: for people who don’t know the system. If they did, they would not go anywhere near such an institution. It’s just not a good deal. It’s not worth the time or the money. It won’t afford a graduate any prestige or competitive advantage and, in the long term, may serve as a source of embarrassment.\n\nI couldn’t help but feel the life expectations of the students were being managed significantly downwards.\n\nGiven how much a university education costs, the posters seemed deeply unfair and even predatory. I know those posters wouldn’t be hanging on the walls of say, Eton, Harrow or any other predominately white and wealthy school.\n\nI went to one of these universities. I didn’t have the A-level results to attempt Oxbridge but I was accepted at one of the best institutions in the country. However, because the course offered wasn’t the one I had my heart set on, I went to a university near where I grew up. At the time, I also couldn’t fathom how I would afford to transport my stuff to a different city.\n\nAfter starting my degree, I quickly learned my grades were stellar compared to my peers, some of whom had got in with nothing more than a D grade in one A-level subject. As a result, I learned a strong and expensive life-lesson in not selling myself short and knowing the system.\n\nI later learned the quality of teaching I had experienced was vastly inferior to that of my peers at more robust institutions. It wasn’t hard to see why: some of the lecturers at my university, although lovely people, couldn’t competently communicate in English. Others were woefully poor at their jobs. Some expected so little from the students that they would apportion 10 per cent of the overall marks to those who simply showed up to a particular percentage of lectures.\n\nSome students only seemed to be attending university because it offered them a consistent and reliable market to sell drugs or promote raves and mix-tapes. There was a band of truly brilliant, interested, driven and dedicated students, who did graduate with good degrees.\n\nUpon entering the professional workforce, I quickly learned that what you studied – unless it was medicine or something similarly specific – was completely irrelevant compared to where you studied.\n\nFor example, a person who graduated with first-class honours in rocket science from, say, London Metropolitan University, is, I’m afraid, significantly less likely to actually become a rocket scientist than a person who graduated in, say, poetry from Durham.\n\nWhen you speak to young black people either university bound or in university, the names of the same set of institutions pop up.\n\nIt is rare that they are the best universities. The last generation of black Britons made these mistakes repeatedly; it would be a tragedy for today’s young black Brits to do the same. The reality of attending these intuitions is that graduates will struggle to compete with their peers, fuelling the black unemployment crisis.\n\nSo, for the avoidance of doubt, the system works as follows: get your children on the path to prosperity (not pittance) by getting them into the best university. Look at the Russell Group schools and accept absolutely nothing less. If that means they have to keep retaking their A-levels, so be it. In the long term they, you and we will all be smiling as a result. This is the system, learn it, then beat it.	2017-06-26 23:32:05.846471+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	41	1018	
1371	Can you excuse casual racism?		http://www.voice-online.co.uk/sites/default/files/voice_logo.png	http://www.voice-online.co.uk/article/can-you-excuse-casual-racism	\N	Was the ethnicity of the alleged troublemakers really that important to mention, especially to a black man?\nMany black people are often wary of crying racism, for fear that they’ll be accused of ‘playing the race card’.\nNow, on occasion, incidents like the chatty engineer’s “blacks and Greeks” comment, leave us unsure of whether seemingly innocent remarks hide casual racism.\nI had similar thoughts upon hearing another story recently from one of my friends (another black man).\nAnd with the video titled ‘Racist guy following us’, it’s clear the teen believes he is a victim of racism.	Image Text: CAUGHT OUT: a black American teenager filmed a white shop assistant who kept following him in a store and posted the video on YouTube\n\nLAST WEEK, my husband took the morning off work to wait for an engineer, who was due to arrive at our home between 8am and midday (you know they can never give a specific time). Upon arrival, the engineer – a white, middle aged man – soon proved himself to be one of the chatty ones, talking to my other half as if he’d known him for years.\n\nThe workman then asked my spouse how he liked the area, before telling him: “Yeah, I used to like it round here, but then all the fighting started between the blacks and the Greeks.”\n\nWhen my husband – who is black – relayed this story to me, I was unsure of what to say or how to feel. I just couldn’t seem to find the appropriate emotion. Part of me wanted to laugh at the sheer tactlessness of the engineer, while another part of me wondered whether the man was a casual racist.\n\nWas the ethnicity of the alleged troublemakers really that important to mention, especially to a black man? If the alleged fighting had been between groups of white boys, would the engineer have stated this when sharing his feelings about the area?\n\nI asked friends what they made of the scenario. Some were in no doubt that the man was racist; others thought he was just relaying a fact; and some felt he was simply tactless to say that to a black man. I remained unsure.\n\nMany black people are often wary of crying racism, for fear that they’ll be accused of ‘playing the race card’. Meanwhile, others are quick to find racism in situations where, perhaps, there is none. But with much of today’s racial prejudice being far less overt than it was in years gone by, (the days of hotel doors featuring the infamous ‘no blacks, no Irish, no dogs’ signs are, thankfully, behind us), racism is often not as black and white as it once was.\n\nNow, on occasion, incidents like the chatty engineer’s “blacks and Greeks” comment, leave us unsure of whether seemingly innocent remarks hide casual racism. And without knowing for sure, should such incidents be brushed under the carpet?\n\nThink back to last year when Naomi Campbell accused Cadbury of racism. In an advertising campaign for a new chocolate bar, the confectionery giant went with the strapline, “Move over Naomi, there’s a new diva in town.” To put it mildly, the supermodel was not best pleased, accusing Cadbury of being racist by likening black people to chocolate.\n\n\n\nCONTROVERSY: Naomi Campbell (below) felt that this 2011 Cadbury advert was racist\n\nSome black people were in full support of Naomi’s complaint. Recalling the type of racism that took place in English schools of yesteryear, where black children were teased about their skin looking like chocolate, many felt that Cadbury was indeed racist to liken a black model to a chocolate bar.\n\nBut then there were those who rubbished the cries of racism, firmly believing that Cadbury was referencing Campbell’s diva reputation and not her skin colour.\n\nSo when it’s impossible to prove whether or not an incident is racist, should we be up in arms about it?\n\nI had similar thoughts upon hearing another story recently from one of my friends (another black man).\n\nHe told me that he had decided to leave his job as a city broker, after being told by his boss (a white man) that the company thought it best not to send a black man to do a particular job.\n\n“Sometimes, towards the end of the month, the company used to send junior brokers to clients’ houses to get cheques,” recalled my friend, who chose to remain anonymous. “It's fairly normal for small investment houses and it increases that particular month's revenue.\n\n“I was all set to go when my line manager came over, looking sheepish, as if he wasn’t sure what to say. Then, another supervisor – though not the main boss – came over and told me that the boss ‘doesn't want to send a black guy to one of the clients.' Apparently, they thought that a black guy turning up at the client’s house might ‘shock him’.\n\n\n\nIN YOUR FACE: racism in Britain in the 1960s was much more overt than modern day racial prejudice\n\n“They basically decided it would reflect badly on the company somehow, and so told me not to go. I was so angry that I decided to leave my job at the end of that month.”\n\nWhat was interesting about my friend’s saga was that his supervisor didn’t think my friend had any cause to be offended by the company boss’s decision.\n\n“He wasn’t even a little bit bothered when he told me what the boss had decided. In fact, I think he felt like I should have be more understanding about the potential racism of an old man.”\n\nHere lies my issue. While I was disgusted to hear what my friend had been through – and was in no doubt that he was the victim of racism – it got me wondering if any racism can be ‘justified’.\n\nWhen it comes from an old, white Englishman, who grew up as part of a generation where such racism was deemed fair game, should we be surprised?\n\nWhen a middle aged white woman in a restaurant a few years ago asked me where I was from and I replied “London,” and she retorted, “no, where are you really from?”, was she just curious, downright ignorant, or attempting to make me feel that while I may have been born in England, it’s not really “my” country?\n\nWhen shop assistants coincidentally find the need to ‘tidy up’ every area of the shop that a black customer happens to stop at, are they just doing their job, or indirectly insinuating that black people are prone to stealing?\n\nLast year, a black American teenager filmed a white man, assumed to be a shop assistant, who kept following him in a store. In the video, which was posted on YouTube, viewers see the man appearing behind the teen every time he turns a corner.\n\nIt certainly seems that the young man, who is shopping with his friend, is being followed. And with the video titled ‘Racist guy following us’, it’s clear the teen believes he is a victim of racism.\n\nBut unlike the unquestionable racist intent of a white person calling a black person a ‘n****r’, this type of incident (which many of us have experienced whilst shopping), is much harder to prove as being an act of racism.\n\nThe fact is, racism today comes in many different guises and very often it’s hard to prove. So when the motive, the reason or the thinking behind incidents of potential racism is unclear, should those incidents be challenged or just shrugged off?	2017-06-26 23:32:07.046757+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	41	1019	
1384	The ideal of autonomy		http://www.spiked-online.com/furedi_auto.jpg	http://www.spiked-online.com/spiked-review/article/the-ideal-of-autonomy/\n19867\n	\N	Its assumption that through self-governance the life of a community would flourish underwrote the development of the modern ideal of autonomy.\nHence, in order to respect people’s moral autonomy, tolerance towards social attitudes is as necessary as tolerance towards beliefs and opinions.\nEven at the best of times, individual autonomy is an ideal that can be realised inconsistently.\nBut the difficulties that stand in the way of realising personal autonomy do not negate this ideal.\nThat individuals sometimes fail to exercise autonomy or make choices that are against their interests, does not devalue this principle.	This important concept developed by the Greeks acquired a more compelling dimension with the development of a rationality-based moral philosophy in the 18th century. This philosophy elaborated on a morality based on self-governance by recognising the transformative power of reason.\n\nThis was an optimistic cultural outlook that believed that all human beings had the potential for understanding what was morally valuable. Its assumption that through self-governance the life of a community would flourish underwrote the development of the modern ideal of autonomy.\n\nMoral independence\n\nAn autonomous person is presumed to possess moral independence – that is, he or she can act with moral responsibility. Through the exercise of autonomy, people can develop their personality by assuming responsibility for their lives. The cultivation of moral independence requires that people are free to deliberate and come to their own conclusions about the views and opinions they hear. As the philosopher Ronald Dworkin explained:\n\n‘Government insults its citizens, and denies their moral responsibility, when it decrees that they cannot be trusted to hear opinions that might persuade them to dangerous or offensive convictions. We retain our dignity, as individuals, only by insisting that no one – no official and no majority – has the right to withhold an opinion from us on the grounds that we are not fit to hear and consider it.’\n\nThrough reflecting freely on opinions and deciding for ourselves what is good and bad, we learn to behave as responsible and independent citizens. In the course of such deliberations, people not only forge their own opinions but also influence the views of others. The exercise of moral responsibility thus possesses an active dimension insofar as we seek to communicate our views to our fellow citizens.\n\nThe exercise of moral autonomy requires that people are able to be themselves, act in accordance with their inclinations and tastes, and feel free to adopt a lifestyle that allows them to express their personality. As Dworkin stated, ‘citizens have as much right to contribute to the formation of the moral or aesthetic climate as they do to participate in politics’. Hence, in order to respect people’s moral autonomy, tolerance towards social attitudes is as necessary as tolerance towards beliefs and opinions. Or, as another philosopher, Joseph Raz, wrote, ‘autonomy requires that many morally acceptable, though incompatible, forms of life be available to a person’.\n\nFreedom constrained\n\nValuing autonomy doesn’t reflect a naive, populist belief that the public can do no wrong. Millions of people continue to fall prey to conspiracy theories, prejudices and irrational influences. Even at the best of times, individual autonomy is an ideal that can be realised inconsistently. People live in a world not of their own making and in circumstances that often elude their aspiration to determine their own affairs. The exercise of autonomy has always come up against external constraints – natural obstacles, economic exigencies, wars, conflict and social dislocation. Today, it also faces a cultural climate that is deeply suspicious of the aspiration for autonomous behaviour.\n\nThe recognition that autonomy is morally valuable and that people’s attempts to make their own lives should be respected does not mean that people always make the right choices for themselves. Nor should an ideal be confused with the attempt to realise it. Formidable obstacles always stand in the way of individuals who wish to be the authors of their own lives.\n\nBut the difficulties that stand in the way of realising personal autonomy do not negate this ideal. People possess the potential for making their own lives. As with all freedoms, how autonomy is exercised and whether its potential is reached depend on specific circumstances. As Dworkin points out, there is a clear distinction to be made between the ‘general point or value of autonomy and its consequences for a particular person on a particular occasion’.\n\nIt is precisely because autonomy is difficult to achieve that a democratic society must foster a climate that is hospitable to individual, social and political experimentation. Even in the most difficult of circumstances, it is important to act on the presumption that people have a capacity for autonomy. Why? Because, though we cannot choose who we are, we can still possess a measure of freedom to choose what we do.\n\nLike all the ideals that are associated with freedom, moral independence cannot be taken for granted. It needs to be lived and fought for. That individuals sometimes fail to exercise autonomy or make choices that are against their interests, does not devalue this principle. Striving for autonomy is inextricably linked to the development of the human potential.\n\nThe intimate connection between humanity and autonomy was recognised by the Greek philosopher Aristotle, whose vision of human flourishing emphasised self-direction and choice. Aristotle claimed that it was through the self-directed activity of making choices and evaluating these experiences that individuals can cultivate the virtues necessary to lead a good life.\n\nFree choice\n\nAll too often, the significance of making choices is trivialised by critics who regard it as the functional equivalent of going shopping and choosing one brand over another. Critics of choice sometimes argue that most people aren’t presented with real choices, and that therefore autonomy is an illusion.\n\nWhat critics of autonomy fail to grasp is that, whatever the obstacles that stand in the way of freely determined action, humanity can only act responsibly through striving for autonomy. It is difficult to hold ourselves or others to account for choices that we assume are not of our own making. From this perspective, the right to choose is not simply important for the flourishing of the individual concerned. Freely determined action develops our capacity to make judgements and to act on them, and, in turn, we become accountable for our actions to others. The corollary of the right to choose is the willingness to be held responsible for the consequences of our choices.\n\nMoral independence, accomplished through the right to choose, is integral to a genuinely human vision of freedom. Autonomy, which is realised through an independent exercise of judgement, can only flourish in a society that trusts its citizens. That is why, in the end, how we view choice is determined by whether or not we trust each other as members of a common moral universe.\n\nFrank Furedi is a sociologist and commentator.

1385	The puzzle of identity		http://www.spiked-online.com/descombes.jpg	http://www.spiked-online.com/spiked-review/article/the-puzzle-of-identity/\n19875\n	\N	As French philosopher Vincent Descombes explains in his newly translated book, Puzzling Identities, this is a distinctly modern question.\nAnd so familiar are we today with the question of identity, the question of my identity, that we barely interrogate the meaning of the question.\nHe looks at how the question of identity – ‘who is he?’ – was originally little more than a third-person inquiry.\nThere are other biographical details which further identify Vincent Descombes as that Vincent Descombes.\nBut the question of identity, the question of who someone is, has acquired a deeper, first-person sense.	Who am I? As French philosopher Vincent Descombes explains in his newly translated book, Puzzling Identities, this is a distinctly modern question. Of course, it looks simple enough. And so familiar are we today with the question of identity, the question of my identity, that we barely interrogate the meaning of the question.\n\nBut that is precisely what Descombes does in the first part of Puzzling Identities. He looks at how the question of identity – ‘who is he?’ – was originally little more than a third-person inquiry. It is the type of question the reader might well be asking now: who is Vincent Descombes? We can say that he was born in 1943. We can say he is a professor of philosophy at the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales in Paris. We can say, too, that he is an author of several prized works, beginning with Le Même et l’Autre, which was published in English in 1980 as Modern French Philosophy. There are other biographical details which further identify Vincent Descombes as that Vincent Descombes. He studied philosophy and sociology at the Sorbonne in the 1960s, for instance, and, while there, he was a member of the anti-Stalinist Marxist group, Socialisme ou Barbarie.\n\nSo far, so Wikipedia. But the question of identity, the question of who someone is, has acquired a deeper, first-person sense. It is no longer simply the elementary question of us establishing who he or she is, from their name and date of birth, to their occupation and interests; it is also a moral-psychological question for me or you to attempt to answer for ourselves, a subjective project, an individual quest for that identity for which we want to be recognised, valued and esteemed. And as such, it is often a difficult, vexed question, one experienced by adolescents, for instance, as a problem as they struggle between the values of their parents and those, perhaps, of their peers, or better still, an ‘identity crisis’ to use the famous formulation of Erik Erikson, who plays such a prominent role in Puzzling Identities.\n\nWhat happened?, I ask Descombes over email. How did ‘who am I?’, a question that, as he argues, wouldn’t have made any sense to an Ancient Athenian or, indeed a Medieval peasant, come to be a defining question of the modern age, generating endless self-presentation on social media, and fuelling the ceaseless demand for recognition of who I am? What was it that prompted Oscar Wilde to predict that, while ‘“Know thyself” was written over the portal of the Antique world, over the portal of the new world, “Be thyself” shall be written’. Descombes’ initial answer is pithy: ‘Between Pericles and us, something took place: Christianity has been active. It has extended to all human beings without exception the concern for personal salvation.’\n\nWhat distinguishes modern man from traditional man is his refusal to invest his literal identity with a normative function\n\nDescombes is right, of course. Christianity did make the question of one’s salvation or, indeed, damnation, a personal concern, a matter of outward devotion and inward faith. In Puzzling Identities, he cites Hegel from Outlines of the Philosophy of Right (1820): ‘The right of the subject’s particularity, his right to be satisfied, or in other words the right of subjective freedom, is the pivot and centre of the difference between antiquity and modern times. This right in its infinity is given expression in Christianity and it has become the universal effective principle of a new form of the world.’\n\nHegel’s ‘right of subjective freedom’ is roughly equivalent to what we might think of today as individualism. It is the right of the individual to formulate and act upon his or her own conception of what he deems to be good - his ‘right to be satisfied’. But the question of identity is more than that. It is a form of subjective freedom, but its object is not salvation, or even the good; its object is the self itself. In other words, it is the right of the individual to formulate his or her own conception of his or her self.\n\nI ask Descombes to expand on the reasons for this development, beyond the advent of Christianity. His answer seems to rest on the changes that occur in the shift from the politically mediated relations operative under feudalism to the freer, economically mediated relations of capitalism. Or the ‘great disembedding’, as he calls it. His response is worth quoting in full:\n\n‘Just as [the philosopher] Charles Taylor does, I draw the idea of “the great disembedding” from Karl Polanyi’s The Great Transformation (1944), where it applies to the fact that the economy has been conceived as an independent system, governed by its own laws and inherently able to find by itself its point of equilibrium. In Polanyi’s thought, the transformation he is telling us about boils down to a differentiation between the domain of economy (a domain governed by natural laws) and the domain of politics.\n\n‘Now, Taylor gives to the term a new application by describing the modern individual as somehow “disembedded” from the social fabric in which he is born and has been raised. Here, Taylor is following the anthropologist Louis Dumont who, in From Mandeville to Marx (1977), integrated Polanyi’s views into a general account of the process generating us, modern individuals, out of pre-modern human beings. Dumont points out that in Ancient times and during the Middle Ages, it was not impossible to become an independent individual, but that there was a price to pay for such an emancipation. The price to be paid at the time of the Roman Empire was becoming a paradoxical philosopher – such as the Stoics.	2017-06-26 23:32:56.381745+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	53	1033	
1386	The strange death of liberal Europe		http://www.spiked-online.com/images/hungary_fence.jpg	http://www.spiked-online.com/spiked-review/article/the-strange-death-of-liberal-europe/\n19861\n	\N	In Britain, the experience of Ray Honeyford in criticising the problem of parallel communities was telling.\nBut the sharpest cause of concern over parallel communities was the increasing tally of Islamist terrorist attacks involving people born and brought up in Europe.\nThe vacillation of Europe’s leaders was epitomised by Merkel’s response to the migrant crisis in 2015: ‘We can do this’ (‘Wir schaffen das’).\nThe European public continues to have a sense of these collective interests, but they are mostly unknown and unarticulated by Europe’s political class.\nFollow him on Twitter: @JonHolbThe Strange Death of Europe: Immigration, Identity, Islam, by Douglas Murray, is published by Bloomsbury Continuum.	The weakness of European political culture in the postwar era was evident in the absence of any notion that it was even possible to expect immigrants to endorse liberal democracy. Immigration, in the absence of assimilation, inevitably meant that parallel communities developed. And having discounted the possibility of assimilating immigrants, Europe’s leaders were left with two options: either curtail immigration and encourage repatriation or ignore the problem. Enoch Powell’s infamous ‘Rivers of Blood’ speech in 1968 was an attempt to do the former. He warned that Britain was ‘mad, literally mad… to be permitting the annual inflow of some 50,000 dependants’. He said this immigration was ‘like watching a nation busily engaged in heaping up its own funeral pyre’.\n\nPowell was immediately relieved of his position in the shadow cabinet, and his political career was over. But instead of giving rise to a debate about how to assimilate immigrants, the sidelining of Powell gave political leaders an easy way of silencing any debate on immigration: dismiss it as racist, or – and this amounted to the same thing – dismiss it as Powellite.\n\nWhen the problem of parallel communities could no longer be ignored, European societies entered the era of multiculturalism, an era that advocated an acceptance and celebration of cultural difference. Those who advocated a desire to see immigrants embrace liberal democracy were dealt with harshly. In Britain, the experience of Ray Honeyford in criticising the problem of parallel communities was telling. In 1984, Honeyford, the headmaster of a Bradford school, published an article noting the refusal of some Muslim fathers to permit their daughters to participate in dance classes, drama or sport, and the silence of the authorities on this and other cultural practices, such as taking children back to Pakistan during term time. He also argued for pupils to be encouraged to speak English and understand British culture.\n\nThe race-relations industry, which Honeyford had also criticised, organised a campaign against him and the Muslim mayor of Bradford claimed that, for his ‘cultural chauvinism’, Honeyford should be sacked. ‘Raycist’ Honeyford, as his critics dubbed him, was forced into early retirement for challenging parallel communities at a time when British politicians had abandoned any notion of assimilation in favour of its antithesis: multiculturalism.\n\nIn this second era, which started in the 1980s, European politicians made a virtue of their political weakness by implicitly recognising that their belief in liberal democracy was so lacking that they would promote the politics of difference, dressed up first as ‘multiculturalism’ and then as ‘diversity’. In this era, there were few Ray Honeyfords who were intellectually strong enough to challenge the problem of parallel communities in the face of politicians who furnished a race-relations industry with money and prestige to celebrate cultural difference.\n\nBut bad political ideas that go unchallenged by the political class will eventually be challenged by the public. And so it was that the advocates of multiculturalism generated a public backlash. In 2006, the Dutch justice minister, Piet Hein Donner, caused significant anger in the Netherlands when he suggested that Muslims could change Dutch law to Sharia by democratic means. There was at least equal public outrage in Britain when, in 2008, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, suggested that the adoption of elements of Sharia law in the UK ‘seems unavoidable’. Murray notes that ‘it suddenly seemed as though some of the absolute bases of Western civilisation were being offered up for negotiation’. In the early 2000s, stories that the Sikh and white working-class communities had been telling for years about the organised grooming of young girls by gangs of Muslim men started to be taken seriously by the media and police. But the sharpest cause of concern over parallel communities was the increasing tally of Islamist terrorist attacks involving people born and brought up in Europe.\n\nBad political ideas that go unchallenged by the political class will eventually be challenged by the public\n\nThe political leaders of Germany, Britain and France eventually responded. In October 2010, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, gave a state-of-the-nation speech in which she said, ‘Of course, the approach to build a multicultural society and to live side-by-side and to enjoy each other has failed, utterly failed’. That was why, she insisted, ‘integration is so important’ and immigrants in Germany must follow the laws and constitution of Germany and speak German.\n\nIn February 2011, Britain’s prime minister, David Cameron, gave a speech in Munich critical of ‘the doctrine of state multiculturalism’ by which ‘we have encouraged different cultures to live separate lives, apart from each other and apart from the mainstream’. A few days later, the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, also pronounced multiculturalism to be a ‘failure’, saying: ‘The truth is that in all our democracies we have been too preoccupied with the identity of those who arrived and not enough with the identity of the country that welcomed them.’\n\nAfter six decades of allowing and encouraging immigrants to live separate lives, the public had forced Europe’s leaders to change the narrative on immigration. Murray points out how extraordinary it was that it took 60 years of immigration before Europe’s political leaders even stated that immigrants should speak the language of the country they entered. And, just as striking, that during those six decades ‘such a demand would have been – and was – attacked as “racist”’.\n\nIn this new era, the gulf between the people and their leaders can no longer be ignored, but it still exists. Despite European leaders recognising that multiculturalism has failed, they lack a political perspective that can solve the immigration issue. The problem remains unresolved because, as David Cameron had recognised in his Munich speech, ‘We’ve failed to provide a vision of society to which they [immigrants] feel they want to belong’. In the absence of a vision, immigrants will continue to have little to assimilate into, and political leaders will fall back on lightweight reasons in favour of immigration, such as short-term economic expediency, misplaced guilt about global hardship, or simply the moral affirmation that comes from appearing to be nice.\n\nThe vacillation of Europe’s leaders was epitomised by Merkel’s response to the migrant crisis in 2015: ‘We can do this’ (‘Wir schaffen das’). But Merkel could not claim to be speaking for the German people, since the German public did not support more immigration, least of all an influx of one million asylum seekers in a year. Neither did she have any idea what ‘this’ referred to. But what mattered was that, as Merkel put it, ‘The world sees Germany as a land of hope and chances. And that wasn’t always the case.’ This was Germany’s chance to atone for the Second World War and to portray itself as a country that people would migrate into rather than flee from.\n\nIn the absence of ‘a vision of society’ that can command popular support, Europe’s leaders will continue to stumble from one migrant crisis to another because the immediate emotional claims of a migrant will tend to trump the collective interests of a nation. The European public continues to have a sense of these collective interests, but they are mostly unknown and unarticulated by Europe’s political class.\n\nLiberal democracy has many political foundations such as the separation of church and state, free speech, the equal rights of women and gays, democracy and the rule of law. Yet these ideas are alien to many immigrants, particularly Muslims, who come from different political cultures. Only a nation with a strong political culture that believes in these ideas can challenge those who do not accept them. A nation with a strong belief in liberal democracy would appreciate the need to assimilate immigrants to its political values, and it would not accept the existence of parallel communities. Least of all would it celebrate cultures with backward views on politics, religion, free speech, equal rights and so forth.\n\nMurray is a compelling writer who, in The Strange Death of Europe, has compiled an array of evidence and argument in support of his claim that ‘the movement of millions of people into a guilty, jaded and dying culture cannot’ work. As his colleague at the Spectator, Matthew Parris, says, he ‘writes so well that when he is wrong he is dangerous.’\n\nIn my opinion Murray’s conclusion is not wrong, but there is a difficulty for anyone tackling subjects as contentious as immigration, identity and Islam. And that is the relationship between cause and symptom. Immigrants are not the cause of Europe’s woes, and parallel communities are a symptom of Europe’s political weakness. Immigrants have never been required or incentivised to assimilate; indeed, since the 1980s, the politics of multiculturalism has incentivised them not to assimilate. Easy though it is to blame the immigrant (a mistake often made by the populist parties of Europe), those who criticise postwar immigration must never lose sight of the fact that the easy target is the wrong target.\n\nWhen reading Murray’s excellent book, it is worth remembering that, of his two arguments, it is the second that is causative of the first. In other words, it is because Europe is dying that immigration has become a politically fraught issue. The target of our anger has to be, not the immigrant, but our political leaders who, over six decades, have had so little belief in liberal democracy that they have never expected immigrants to assimilate to the political values that made Europe such a desirable place to live.\n\nJon Holbrook is a barrister He is giving a lecture on the Legal Subject as part of The Academy on 15 July 2017.

1387	Reimagining social hope		http://www.spiked-online.com/aronson.jpg	http://www.spiked-online.com/spiked-review/article/reimagining-social-hope/\n19868\n	\N	Was there a kernel of social hope in his election victory?\nThat part of his writing really inspired my own work and is embedded in what I’m trying to describe as social hope.\nDo you remain positive about a reimagining of social hope?\nI was exploring our roots – what is the basis within us for reconnecting with a deeper sense of social hope that motivated past generations?\nHe is the author, most recently, of We: Reviving Social Hope, published by University of Chicago Press.	Whelan: Where has this feeling of an obsession with the individual come from? It’s always dangerous to reduce the 1960s, which encompassed the diverse aspirations of the New Left as well as the counter-culture. But, overall do you think that there was perhaps too much of a tendency to make the personal political, and self-esteem central? Has that led, in part, to this crises of individuality – this obsession with individuality?\n\nAronson: You’re making a good point, and you want to press me on this, which is good. Because I wrote in the 1960s on behalf of that individualism, feeling that that individualism was potentially revolutionary. The 1960s was central to my own development and my own writing and thinking and acting. It was a rebellion against the conformity of the earlier period. I mentioned Brave New World and Nineteen Eighty-Four and We. There are two other books that are part of that stream that most people don’t usually consider. One is Allen Ginsberg’s Howl, which was this massive poem about the struggle for individual survival and integrity in the totalitarian society. And then, there’s Herbert Marcuse’s One-Dimensional Man, which is about a society without opposition. There’s barely a space for authentic individualism in that book. So, you might say there was a rebellion, in part, on behalf of the need for individual identity and flourishing.\n\nYou’re not saying this, but I think often a very cheap and easy way to describe it is to simply say: ‘Well that individualism has gone too far and it led to neoliberalism’. And there is something in that, except that the individualism, as it developed, immediately got seized upon by the capitalism system as a way of ensuring profit and economic growth. It’s not simply that individuals have gone too far, but that individuals have also lost a sense of collectivity. It’s a sense that you have no responsibility beyond yourself.\n\nThe genesis of this is complex. There is an element in the 1960s, but the element in the economic system is crucial – and in the consumer society, as part of what makes up this privatisation of hope I describe. The ideology is a big part – the ideology of what we call right-wing think-tanks, neoliberal think-tanks and neoliberal ideologists in the US and the UK. They promote a way of thinking which is quite magical – which says that individuals on their own will somehow magically produce the best result for society. That’s way beyond what we envisioned in the 1960s. It’s more deeply to do with the needs of the current economic system.\n\nWhelan: What do you make of the contemporary obsession with self-invention and reinvention? The end point of much of that movement in the 1960s now isn’t just about neoliberalism, it’s this individualistic obsession with defining and presenting ourselves. Do you think it’s a problem that identity and individuality now is all about how you express yourself?\n\nAronson: There’s quite a problem there. Sociologists like Zygmunt Bauman and even Anthony Giddens and Ulrich Beck have talked about this risk to society, in the way in which it individualised society. It does exactly what you’re talking about – individuals become obsessed with who they are, writing their biography. There’s an incredibly sharp self consciousness about inventing myself and reinventing myself. What is all that about? What is going on there?\n\nI wrote in the 1960s on behalf of individualism, feeling that that individualism was potentially revolutionary\n\nWell, if you look at it closely, it’s a social process. There are social demands made on individuals to do that. The social demands come from the labour market. Individuals have demands made on them – the whole outpouring of various types of pop psychology in which people turn inward to themselves – all this is part of a historical wave. If people spent as much time thinking about their society as they do about themselves individually, we might be able to imagine a balance. But we’re so far from any point of balance. The question might be: how do you combine individual sensibility and self-development with a social awareness and social participation? Well, if we were raised and educated to do both, it might happen. If we had a sense of ourselves as personal individuals, and as belonging to a larger society at the same time, things would be very different. We absolutely do belong, and people need to become aware of it.\n\nBut people are becoming aware of it, in the UK and the US, in both good ways and bad. The bad being the Trump movement, and UKIP. The good being the movements that generated support for Bernie Sanders and the shocking support behind Jeremy Corbyn. People totally didn’t expect a return to a wider sense of community, and that is happening too.\n\nWhelan: You brought up the good and the bad – let’s look at what you consider to be the bad. Like the sociologist Arlie Hochschild, you don’t simply condemn the rise of Trump, and paint his supporters as angry white men, as so many other commentators seek to do. Was there a kernel of social hope in his election victory? Even just in its rejection of the business as usual politics?\n\nAronson: No. That would be similar to asking if there is there a kernel of hope in fascism. But there is something there in the support for Trump. It’s the rejection of the neoliberals in the Republican Party and the Democratic Party – the rejection of leaving people on their own. (Which is the strongest ideology of the other Republican candidates opposed to Trump.) No one really seriously thought about our society and the inequalities that had occurred or the social devastation of the past decade. Trump addressed that, and in that sense, people are saying something is wrong and something has to change. I call that a distorting mirror of hope. It’s hope where you say something has to change – but you say he has to change it. I call it an anti-hope, because you want the great man to come in and solve your problems, instead of some collective movement to find the social sources of the problem and collectively act to make a difference. I know that sounds very much like old-style socialism, but that’s what Bernie Sanders brought back; a politics where we collectively make a difference to democratise society and to search for meaningful social changes that are effective for everybody.\n\nWe make choices, always. We create ourselves, always. But, as Sartre later understood it, under conditions not of our own making and not of our own control\n\nWhelan: Okay, so you argue that Trump wants to act alone, not with a collective. But don’t you think there is potential, simply in the raw rejection of the establishment in the Trump vote, for change? Can the US left harness that?\n\nAronson: Yes – in the resistance against Trump. From within it, all sorts of possibilities are bubbling up. People see themselves as acting together. There is a ‘we’ versus the ‘him’. People see themselves as within a large social movement. It’s not just a matter of defending, for example, Obamacare, which is a very incomplete, partial healthcare system. But, within that, the natural solution to the healthcare crisis that Trump is worsening would be medicare for all – a single-payer national healthcare system. People are saying that – large numbers of people are saying that. So, we see a movement beginning to raise demands for large-scale social change that would benefit everybody. I think that’s built into the anti-Trump resistance. Many people see it moving in that direction. There’s a real possibility there.\n\nWhelan: I want to bring in your previous work now, because your life-long intellectual interest in Sartre is fascinating in this context. What would Sartre make of the ‘psychotherapeutic injunction’, as you put it, ‘to take command of our own lives and become the active subjects of our stories’?\n\nAronson: Well, Sartre sees, particularly in the Critique of Dialectical Reason, and in his later works, the serialised, isolated, separated, individual. An individual who is dominated in that separation and isolation. It’s not just a natural state; it’s a state in which one is passive in relation to the larger social world. Sartre sees that individual under threat, looking around to find other individuals, coming together collectively to find a means to deal with the crises. Sartre very much understood that and wrote about it. That part of his writing really inspired my own work and is embedded in what I’m trying to describe as social hope. That is to say, collectives functioning collectively and overcoming that isolation and separation.\n\nWhelan: How would you assess Sartre’s philosophy of freedom now?\n\nAronson: Well, it’s still there. Sartre’s analysis is still there in that stage of individual development and intellectual understanding. Those stages are still very much there – they’re part of us – they’re part of you and I. So they’re presupposed in everything we do. We make choices, always. We create ourselves, always. But, as Sartre later understood it, under conditions not of our own making and not of our own control. Just as he moved from the understanding of how we make ourselves to an understanding of the conditions under which we make ourselves, and the tools that we are given (sometimes very paltry tools), to make ourselves. He understood the deeper social layers of the process. So, I think we have to take his initial, very striking and important ideas on board, and continue as he did to understanding and struggling in the larger society.\n\nWhelan: Your book is very positive, you talk about the possibility and potential for social change. You write that if somebody like Bernie Sanders can come out of nowhere and make such an intervention, anything can happen. Do you remain positive about a reimagining of social hope?\n\nAronson: I was writing the book in the deepest period of cynicism after Barack Obama’s hope phase. I was exploring our roots – what is the basis within us for reconnecting with a deeper sense of social hope that motivated past generations? And, lo and behold, in 2016, we saw that process happen. Albeit in a false, distorting and mirrored way. But it also happened in a very positive, democratic, collective way with Bernie Sanders. I saw reality proving what I was talking about in my book. So, the postscript in the book is about the 2016 election and Trump. The book really points towards the anti-Trump resistance as the path for recreating hope. Both Bernie and Jeremy Corbyn seem to me to be at least the harbingers of something really new, based on a refusal to let go of our sense of social belonging.\n\nProfessor Ronald Aronson is professor emeritus of the History of Ideas at Wayne State University.

What is it about Stephen Patrick Morrissey that has us all still hooked? His long-awaited autobiography has finally landed and has elbowed that other famous moaner, Bridget Jones, off the bestseller spot, selling a record-breaking 34, 918 copies. In its first week the Manchester Miserablist’s life story has become the most popular music memoir of all time. Which is odd if you consider that over the past four decades he has successfully alienated his fellow Smiths, fans, large swathes of the press and countless celebrities. Prior to publication, rumours had abounded that the book was a hoax and Morrissey’s career was finally over. Amen said many. And yet, here it is – the first book to gain immediate Penguin Classic status. Once again, Morrissey has shown why he is as successful as he is reviled.\n\nThis is no ordinary music memoir. There is little rock and roll nostalgia of the kind peddled by Keith Richards in his popular tome Life (2010), instead it is steeped in the misery, melancholy and narcissism that we have come to expect from Moz. Turning his dislikeability to his advantage is an art that Morrissey perfected long ago, but there’s a certain voyeurism in our fascination with the depths of his despair. In trying to fathom the success of this 457-page ode to self, and the enduring popularity of this 1980s pop icon, it seems clear that Autobiography (as it is ironically titled), follows Morrissey’s pattern of chewing up the rulebook and spitting it out in his own lugubrious manner.	2017-06-26 23:32:34.30752+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	38	1023

What makes humans human? According to Neil MacGregor, director of the British Museum, it’s things. “Making things, and then coming to depend on things” is what “sets us apart from all other animals, and ultimately turns us into the humans we are today,” said MacGregor in his introduction to the 2010 BBC radio series A History of the World in 100 Objects.\n\n\n\nMacGregor’s series won extravagant praise from critics and a large and devoted audience. Each 15-minute episode examined one object from the British Museum’s collections. The oldest was nearly 2 million years old; the newest, a solar-powered lamp and charger, was acquired by the museum especially for the series. At the end of each episode, MacGregor would link that day’s object to the object in the following episode, enabling him to move swiftly from 1st-century Ohio to 4th-century China to 8th-century Mexico.\n\nThree years later, it no longer seems so unusual to tell stories through things. In 2012, the British Museum and Radio 4 teamed up again for Shakespeare’s Restless World, a project which examined Shakespeare’s era and work through 20 objects. But these radio shows are just part of a growing fashion for telling stories through objects. “Object narratives” such as Edmund de Waal’s The Hare With Amber Eyes and Paula Byrne’s recent biography The Real Jane Austen: A Life in Small Things promise to replace the subjective histories we are used to with something more concrete, more trustworthy. Byrne describes Austen as “the most elusive of all our great writers with the exception of Shakespeare.” And the more shadowy or otherwise ungraspable the subject—Shakespeare, Austen, the whole daunting 2 million year history of humanity—the greater the appeal of a narrative which starts with the tangible.	2017-06-26 23:32:35.243881+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	38	1024

Inequality has replaced house prices as a fashionable topic for discussion. But anyone looking for a serious treatment of the problem, rather than just a dinner party conversation, should turn to these books by eminent economists who have made the study of inequality their life’s work. They complement each other: Anthony Atkinson focuses on rising inequality in post-1980 Britain, while François Bourguignon analyses global inequality.\n\nBoth writers balance their diagnoses with concrete proposals for achieving a more equitable distribution of wealth and income. Bourguignon, a former Chief Economist at the World Bank who now teaches at the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales in Paris, makes what is perhaps the most important point: that the same forces of economic globalisation that are rapidly reducing inequality between countries are increasing it within them. Atkinson, a professor at the London School of Economics who has a measure of inequality (the “Atkinson index”) named after him, laments the “turn to inequality” that occurred in the United Kingdom after 1980. However, globally during the same period we have seen a remarkable “turn to equality.” The inexorable rise in global inequality of the past two centuries has been reversed. So much so that the credible future dystopia is no longer Brave New World or 1984, it is Dubai—where the super-rich rub shoulders with the super-poor or, more accurately, have their shoulders rubbed by them.\n\nInequality is an emotive term for a slippery concept. A classic dispute is whether what matters is equality of outcomes or equality of opportunities. Looming technological changes may make these increasingly incompatible. But what struck me most forcibly from reading these analyses is that what economists mean by inequality (and what their various formulae measure) is not what most non-economists have in mind when they say that they are concerned about it. To achieve a significant reduction in inequality as measured by economists, incomes in the central range of the distribution must be compressed: bus drivers must become better off relative to headteachers. But what people actually worry about are the tails of the distribution: children without life chances and the undeserving super-rich. As Jonathan Haidt has recently argued in his book The Righteous Mind, modern social science is radically out of touch with popular morality.	2017-06-26 23:32:52.295771+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	38	1029

Image copyright Gilli Davidson\n\nWhen nine-year-old Niamh died, her mother, Gilli Davidson, knew how she wanted to say goodbye - and her local funeral director made it possible.\n\nNiamh Storey Davidson was diagnosed with a Wilms tumour - a rare kidney cancer affecting children - when she was six.\n\nFor nearly three years she endured treatment, but kept relapsing. The family were told she was terminally ill.\n\n"The thought that she wouldn't be here was unbearable," remembers Gilli.\n\n"She died at home at 1:30 in the afternoon, with me and her dad."\n\nGilli's other children - including Niamh's twin, Zach - were at school or college.\n\nBut through the blur of upset and sorrow, Gilli knew one thing clearly: she wanted to donate Niamh's eyes, the only part of the little girl unaffected by disease.\n\nOrgan donation is very important to Gilli's family - as a baby, one of Niamh's brothers had a heart transplant after contracting a serious chest infection.\n\nShe needed to act fast. By 5pm she was in touch with Arka Original Funerals - a Brighton company that is part of a movement in the UK to re-personalise and de-industrialise death, dying and funerals.\n\nImage copyright Gilli Davidson\n\nWhen funeral director Cara Mair arrived with her colleague, Sarah Clarke-Kent, to pick Niamh up, there was no heavy-duty, black plastic body bag to zip her into.\n\nShe was carried away on a stretcher with a pillow, cotton shroud, and a soft felt covering appliquéd with large leaves.\n\n"Removing someone from their home is such a hard thing for families to witness," says Cara.\n\n"It's important to have something of beauty to wrap them in. A person may have died, but it's still their shell, their vessel."\n\nFind out more\n\nNiamh was taken quickly to Arka's premises, where her eyes were removed by a medical technician that same evening.\n\n"Sarah stayed with Niamh while the procedure was done," says Gilli.\n\n"That was a real gift, because then I knew it had been done really respectfully.\n\n"The man operating told Sarah that Niamh's eyes were beautiful and in great condition, so they would definitely be given to someone else. I was really pleased to hear that."\n\nThe next day, Niamh was taken back home.\n\nKeeping a body at home before a funeral is rare in the UK, but it is not illegal.\n\nThe most important consideration is temperature. Some funeral companies supply air conditioning units in the summer months to keep a body cool, and electric cold blankets may be used as well.\n\nBut in Niamh's case, temperature was not an issue. It was November, so she was placed in a room at home with the windows open.\n\n"She stayed there, lying on an armchair with her blankets and her cushions," remembers Gilli.\n\n"I couldn't possibly have left her somewhere else. It just didn't feel right. She'd just turned nine years old - it still felt as though she was part of me."\n\nImage copyright Gilli Davidson Image caption Niamh and her twin brother Zach aged five - a year before her diagnosis\n\nNiamh would remain at home for nearly three weeks, with her eyes closed.\n\n"We try and slow things down for loved ones, to give time to digest the news of a death. We don't have a prescribed way of doing things," says Cara.\n\nIn the days Niamh was at home, Gilli spent a lot of time with her.\n\n"I was able to wash her. And dress her in her favourite things. The main thing for me was to make her death real.\n\n"If Niamh had just disappeared out of the house, and then a coffin had arrived and I never saw her again, I'd still be searching..."\n\nImage copyright Gilli Davidson\n\nGilli trusted her own instincts on this because - almost unbelievably - she had already experienced the loss of two other children. Her first child, Liam, died shortly after he was born in 1990.\n\n"I remember asking to see him before the funeral, and the chaplain running the service wouldn't let me.\n\n"So for years afterwards, I used to think if someone knocked on the door, and said, 'Oh, there's been a terrible mistake - here's your son,' I would've just accepted it.\n\n"It was as if I didn't really believe he was dead."\n\nIt preyed on Gilli's mind that she had not had one last look at her son. "It made me think - why? Are they trying to trick me? You're in such a strange state after the death of a child."\n\nImage copyright Toby Smedley Image caption Cara Mair is trying to make funerals more personal\n\nIn the UK, it is not common for family and friends to view a body in a casket just before burial or cremation. But Cara Mair says that for some clients this is important.\n\n"When the coffin's closed, they know they've been the last to see that person, so they can rest assured they're undisturbed.\n\n"It's not the same for everyone - this might freak some people out. But the choice to do it needs to be there, and the funeral profession needs to be comfortable with it."\n\nFind out more\n\nCara Mair and Sarah Clarke-Kent encourage bereaved families to get involved in every aspect of the funeral process.

She had learned some lessons from her first bereavement but the funeral service still seemed all wrong.\n\n"It was too wordy for a tiny baby. And the funeral director had put in a lot of religion, which had nothing to do with me," she says.\n\nGilli remembered a conversation she had with Niamh before she died.\n\n"We were walking to the park with her twin, and she said she wanted to be buried. She didn't like the idea of fire, and was adamant about that."\n\nBut Gilli hated the idea of a graveyard - dark, and foreboding, and so unlike her shy little girl.\n\nThe family settled on a woodland burial. Gilli was not sure she wanted to put her daughter in a coffin, so Arka advised her that Niamh could be buried only in a shroud.\n\nBut at the last minute, her father changed his mind, and Niamh was placed in a wicker coffin.\n\n"In the time she'd been at home since she'd died, she hadn't really changed very much," remembers Sarah Clarke-Kent. "She looked very peaceful and small."\n\nImage copyright Gilli Davidson\n\nNiamh loved dogs. So on the day of the funeral, her street was filled with neighbours, friends, children and their pets.\n\n"It was very moving how they stayed involved and in control of Niamh's funeral, and it was a privilege to support them," says Cara Mair.\n\nShe drove Niamh's coffin slowly up the street followed by a walking procession of mourners and well-wishers.\n\nThe balloons were released, and then everyone got into their cars and drove to the woodland burial site.\n\nImage copyright Brighton Argus/Solent Image caption Pets were welcome at Niamh's funeral\n\nThe day has stayed with Gilli.\n\n"It really did feel right.\n\n"The funeral's only the start of saying goodbye, but it's such an important start - it's the beginning of moving on to the next chapter of life without that person.\n\n"And if death isn't dealt with in a good way, the bereavement gets stuck, and that can affect your life and your children's."\n\nGilli's family had an overwhelming response to their decision to donate Niamh's eyes.\n\n"A lot of people got in touch with us," says Gilli.\n\n"We have this cultural idea that the eyes are the windows to the soul, so it's common for organ donors to write on their cards that they don't want their eyes to be taken.\n\n"Many people wrote to us to say they had changed their minds about that after hearing Niamh's story."\n\nAnd when Gilli heard her daughter's corneas had been transplanted successfully, giving sight to a teenager and a young man, she was delighted.\n\n"It means a little bit of Niamh has lived on - that's her legacy."\n\nListen to Heart and Soul: Giving death back to the people on BBC World Service\n\nMore from the Magazine\n\nImage copyright Reg Green\n\nOn the night of 29 September 1994, seven-year-old Nicholas Green was fatally shot during a family holiday in southern Italy.

Image copyright Microsoft Image caption Microsoft had attacked Google's email scans claiming they were an invasion of privacy\n\nGoogle's decision to stop scanning Gmail users' emails in order to target them with personalised adverts has been given a qualified welcome by privacy campaigners.\n\nThe tech firm revealed the change in a blog at the end of last week.\n\nGoogle promised to make the move before the year's end to bring the consumer version of Gmail in line with its business edition.\n\nThe firm had faced much criticism over the years for the scans.\n\nGmail man\n\nThe measure helped justify the cost of offering the public one gigabyte of "free" webmail storage in 2004 - an offer that was so much greater than the competition at the time that many originally believed it to be a joke.\n\nHowever, UK-based campaign group Privacy International tried to block the scans once it became apparent they were the cost of signing up to the service. The organisation tried and failed to get the country's data privacy regulator to intervene.\n\nThen, a decade later, Microsoft ran a series of adverts, in which it first depicted a "Gmail man" searching through people's messages, and then went on to accuse the search giant of "crossing the line" causing its customers to be "Scroogled".\n\n"When they first came up with the dangerous idea of monetising the content of our communications, Privacy International warned Google against setting the precedent of breaking the confidentiality of messages for the sake of additional income," the charity's executive director Dr Gus Hosein told the BBC.\n\n"Of course they can now take this decision after they have consolidated their position in the marketplace as the aggregator of nearly all the data on internet usage, aside from the other giant, Facebook.\n\n"The reality is that what you choose to say over email to another human being isn't as interesting for exploitation as the data you have no control over - Google would rather exploit your data by tracking you across the internet, across their mobile operating system, their search engine, their apps, their smart devices, and likely some day soon, their car, amongst a myriad of other services that they dominate through the exploitation of our data."\n\nGoogle's blog notes that users can opt out of seeing personalised ads on any of its services by changing their account settings.\n\nImage copyright Google Image caption The advert scans had helped justify the cost of providing Gmail to consumers for free\n\nAnother digital rights body, Big Brother Watch, was a little more positive.\n\n"Whilst it could be seen as closing the stable door once the horse has bolted, there is no doubt that the end to the intrusive and frankly creepy process will be appreciated by a great many Gmail users," commented its chief executive Renate Samson.\n\n"However, none of us must rest on our laurels.\n\n"Whilst tech companies should see this as an opportunity to halt other intrusive snooping for advertising purposes, citizens equally should take greater care not to sign up to services which routinely share your personal information with third parties for the purposes of advertising or marketing.\n\n"Google's move is absolutely a step in the right direction, let's hope it encourages others to follow suit."\n\nWhile the ad-driven scans should soon stop, the news site Ars Technica has highlighted that Gmail messages will still be scanned by Google to provide artificial intelligence-powered "smart replies", malware-protection and sorting for search queries.	2017-06-26 23:33:15.785532+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	9	1050	['Leo Kelion', 'Technology Desk Editor']

Image copyright SPACEX Image caption Iridium has booked SpaceX for multiple missions that will leave Earth from the Vandenberg Air Force Base on the California coast\n\nUS rocket company SpaceX completed back-to-back launches at the weekend.\n\nLate on Friday, it used one of its refurbished Falcon 9 vehicles to put up a Bulgarian satellite from Florida.\n\nThen on Sunday, SpaceX lofted another 10 spacecraft for telecommunications company Iridium. This time, the rocket flew out of California.\n\nBoth missions saw the Falcon first-stages come back to Earth under control to drone ships that had been positioned out on the ocean.\n\nIt means SpaceX has now had 13 landing successes for those missions it has sought to recover the booster. That said, Friday's first-stage had a particularly hard landing, and looked bent over on the live video feed.\n\n"Rocket is extra toasty and hit the deck hard (used almost all of the emergency crush core), but otherwise good," quipped SpaceX chief executive, Elon Musk, on Twitter.\n\nHis firm does not expect to recover every booster, because the flight profile required on many satellite launches will lead to re-entry speeds that are simply too fast to curtail with the available propellant.\n\nFriday's mission was launched from the US East Coast, from the Kennedy Space Center's famous Apollo and shuttle pad, 39A.\n\nImage copyright SPACEX Image caption New grid fins: To make recycling rockets pay, SpaceX must reduce the amount of refurbishment needed\n\nThe "second-hand" Falcon 9 lifted off at 15:10 local time (1910 GMT).\n\nIts passenger, BulgariaSat-1, was dropped off in orbit, some 30 minutes later.\n\nThe spacecraft will be used to beam TV into homes in Bulgaria and Serbia.\n\nThe Falcon booster was last flown in January, to launch 10 satellites for the Iridium sat-phone and data-relay company. And it was another Iridium launch that topped out the weekend's activities.\n\nThis second mission, on a brand new Falcon, occurred on the West Coast, from the Vandenberg Air Force Base.\n\nIridium is in the midst of replacing its global network of satellites. Another 10 went up on this latest flight.\n\nSpaceX has another six launches on the books for Iridium, whose existing network of more than 60 spacecraft is now well past its design life.\n\nSunday's lift-off occurred at 13:25 local time (20:25 GMT). The returning booster on this occasion sported new titanium grid fins to help steer the vehicle back to its waiting drone ship.\n\nThe titanium ought to be more robust than the previous aluminium type, said Mr Musk, removing the requirement for repair or replacement. This should speed the turnaround of future boosters for re-use.\n\n"New titanium grid fins worked even better than expected. Should be capable of an indefinite number of flights with no service," the CEO tweeted.\n\nImage copyright THALES ALENIA SPACE Image caption The new Iridium satellites are replacing a network that is more than 20 years old\n\nIridium's business is mobile communications, providing connections to anyone who is not near a fixed line. These customers include the military, oil and gas platforms, ships and broadcasters.\n\nIncreasingly, it also includes remote machinery reporting in its status to a central server. This machine-to-machine service has a big future, especially as more and more devices are linked together in the coming, so-called "internet of things".\n\nThe new Iridium satellites also host payloads for two tracking companies. One of is Aireon, which aims to offer a service that reports the positions of aircraft by sensing their ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast) transmissions. This would be useful in following planes that are beyond radar coverage, but could also help airlines plan more efficient routing.\n\nThe other hosted payload is for exactEarth, which does something very similar with ships. Large vessels transmit an Automatic Identification System message that can be sensed from orbit.\n\nAgain, shipping companies can use the tracking service to keep tabs on vessels and to plot the best available course to a port.\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos	2017-06-26 23:33:18.915353+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	9	1052	['Jonathan Amos', 'Bbc Science Correspondent']

If he was into Camilla one bit you’d see him kiss her, you’d see him at least touch her in the day. They have no interaction.”\n\nHe adds: “Since the public vote, Jonny’s attitude has changed. I think it’s because he realised that the public do actually like Camilla and it’s took him two weeks and a bit to really come out of his shell and I think he’s done that because he’s got to keep Camilla on side….\n\n“I think Jonny is playing a really big game.”\n\n7 Chris and Olivia (pictured) agree that Jonny and Camilla are not acting like the other couples\n\nMeanwhile Jonny himself tells the Beach Hut: “[Cam and I] said we were going to move at a real world pace and this isn’t a real world pace, this is just solid, stand still…\n\n“During the day I feel like I’m trying to talk and it’s almost like she doesn’t want to, it’s just the vibe I get… I’m not asking for miracles here I’m just asking for her to let me know where I stand.\n\n“Things can go slow but I like to know where I am as well otherwise I start thinking, what is this girl’s angle?”\n\n7 Camilla and Jonny have been together since he arrived on the island\n\nListening to Jonny’s concerns is Marcel, who kindly agrees to talk to Camilla about the situation and feed back to him.\n\nCamilla, meanwhile, admits in the Beach Hut that “sometimes it’s difficult for Jonny to know how tactile or how friendly [she] can be… because he knows that [she has] certain reservations about that side of things”\n\n7 Jonny and Camilla get extra tactile during a task\n\nLater she confides in Marcel, saying the arrival of Tyla – who is Jonny’s type “on paper” – has knocked her confidence.\n\nShe tells him: “Thing is, he hasn’t given me a single reason to doubt Jonny, this is nothing to do with him this is a personal thing. When someone comes in who you know is the guy that you’re seeing’s type on paper, it can be a bit of a confidence knock.”\n\n7 Jonny entrusts Marcel to get intel from Camilla\n\nShe adds: “I’m not very emotionally readable so I could be thinking ‘I really wish he’d give me a hug right now’ and my face will be saying ‘don’t come anywhere near me, do not touch me.’\n\n“So I have to remember he’s not a mind reader.”\n\n7 The pair have fun during a naughty task\n\nBeing the kind soul he is, Marcel reassures Camilla that Jonny is into him and feeds all the information back to Jonny.\n\nBut will the couple be able to set their concerns aside and continue together on their Love Island journey?\n\nLove Island continues tonight at 9pm on ITV2.	2017-06-26 23:33:47.445739+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	47	1059	['Olivia Waring', 'Showbiz Reporter']

All 75 high-rises to undergo fire safety tests in the wake of the Grenfell Tower blaze have failed so far, Sajid Javid announced as he urged councils to send samples for testing quicker.\n\nThe Communities and Local Government Secretary said cladding on the buildings, which are across 26 council areas, was deemed to be flammable, similar to the cladding that helped the Grenfell fire spread and gut the tower, killing at least 79 people.\n\nPA Wire/PA Images The Grenfell Tower after the devastating fire\n\nJavid told MPs he was concerned that landlords were not submitting samples for testing fast enough and urged them to send them quicker. A total of 600 high rises across Britain are due to be tested.\n\n“The fact that all samples so far have failed the test underlines the value of the testing programme and the vital importance of submitting samples urgently,” he said, adding the lab can test 100 samples a day and runs around the clock.\n\nHe added: “Building Regulations and the system for ensuring fire safety in buildings have been developed over many decades.\n\n“And until the Grenfell Fire many experts would have claimed that system has served us well.\n\n“But now we have witnessed a catastrophic failure, on a scale many thought impossible in 21st century Britain.”\n\nPA Wire/PA Images Sajid Javid: 'We have witnessed a catastrophic failure, on a scale many thought impossible in 21st century Britain'.\n\nJavid’s statement to the Commons comes after Camden Council evacuated five of its high rises blocks on Friday evening, saying it would put up residents elsewhere while urgent work was done to make them safe.\n\nWhile the council was initially accused of overreacting, Javid praised its action, saying: “Landlords must keep residential buildings safe for their tenants.\n\n“Where they cannot satisfy that obligation with appropriate mitigating measures, we expect alternative accommodation to be provided while remedial work is carried out.\n\n“That is exactly what has happened in Camden and I’d like to pay tribute to the residents there for their brave response in such a distressing situation.”\n\nJUSTIN TALLIS via Getty Images People leave a high rise on the Chalcots Estate on Friday evening, after Camden Council ordered the evacuation of five tower blocks\n\nJohn Healey, Javid’s Labour shadow, responded by hitting out at why only 75 had been tested in the nearly two weeks since the fire.\n\nHe said: “Ministers talk too loosely about the ‘buildings or tower blocks tested’ or so far. The Prime Minister said ‘we can test over 100 buildings a day’.\n\n“Will he make clear to the House that the Government’s ‘testing’ is only of cladding samples sent in by councils and housing associations?\n\n“The Government says 600 tower blocks with cladding need safety checks. So why – two weeks on – have only 75 been tested so far? Why have all failed?”\n\nJavid’s comments come after Downing Street revealed schools and hospitals would have their cladding tested as well.\n\nThe US company that sold the cladding that burned on the Grenfell Tower has also announced it was withdrawing it from sale.	2017-06-26 23:33:58.285435+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	19	1068	['Jack Sommers', 'Assistant News Editor', 'Huffpost Uk']

WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump on Monday hailed the Supreme Court’s decision to consider his travel ban as a “clear victory” after the court said it will allow a watered-down version of the ban to say in place until it hears the case in October.\n\n“Today’s unanimous Supreme Court decision is a clear victory for our national security. It allows the travel suspension for the six terror-prone countries and the refugee suspension to become largely effective,” Trump said in a statement. “As President, I cannot allow people into our country who want to do us harm. I want people who can love the United States and all of its citizens, and who will be hardworking and productive.”\n\n“My number one responsibility as Commander in Chief is to keep the American people safe. Today’s ruling allows me to use an important tool for protecting our Nation’s homeland. I am also particularly gratified that the Supreme Court’s decision was 9-0.”\n\nTrump again incorrectly emphasized “the 9-0 decision” in a celebratory tweet on Monday afternoon.\n\nVery grateful for the 9-O decision from the U. S. Supreme Court. We must keep America SAFE! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 26, 2017\n\nSeveral federal courts have halted enforcement of the ban because they determined it unlawfully discriminates against Muslims.\n\nIn the interim, the court will allow a watered-down version of the ban to go into effect. People with “a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States” will not be subject to the ban. That group includes people coming to visit their family or students coming to study.\n\nTrump’s celebratory statement incorrectly stated that the justices’ decision Monday “was 9-0.” The decision was “per curiam,” meaning that it was unsigned by any particular justices.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas, joined by fellow conservatives Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch, wrote a separate opinion, agreeing with the overall decision but arguing that the ban should be reinstated “in full.”\n\nTrump has frequently lashed out against the independent judiciary in response to multiple lower court decisions that ruled against his administration.\n\nThe president has sometimes gone after judges personally.\n\nThe opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned! — Donald J.

The American Medical Association, the nation’s largest doctors’ group, opposes the Senate health care bill, the organization announced in a letter to Senate leaders Monday.\n\n“Medicine has long operated under the precept of Primum non nocere, or ‘first, do no harm.’ The draft legislation violates that standard on many levels,” American Medical Association CEO James Madara wrote to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.).\n\nThe American Medical Association is the latest health care sector group to express opposition to, or at least serious concerns with, the Senate bill, known as the Better Care Reconciliation Act. McConnell unveiled the bill Thursday and aims to bring it to the Senate floor for a final vote as soon as this week. With 52 Republicans in the Senate, McConnell can only lose two GOP votes if he wants to get the 50 needed to advance the bill. Five Republican senators, however, are already on record against it.\n\nThe physicians’ lobbying organization cites numerous problems with the Senate GOP bill, starting with its likely effect of causing many millions of currently insured Americans to lose their health coverage and be unable to afford medical treatments.\n\n“It seems highly likely that a combination of smaller subsidies resulting from lower benchmarks and the increased likelihood of waivers of important protections such as required benefits, actuarial value standards, and out of pocket spending limits will expose low and middle income patients to higher costs and greater difficulty in affording care,” the AMA’s letter says.\n\nThe group also takes issue with the legislation’s deep cuts to federal Medicaid spending.\n\n“The Senate proposal to artificially limit the growth of Medicaid expenditures below even the rate of medical inflation threatens to limit states’ ability to address the health care needs of their most vulnerable citizens,” the letter says.\n\nThe legislation would make tax credits for private health insurance created by the Affordable Care Act available to fewer people, reduce their value and tie them to plans that have larger deductibles and higher out-of-pocket costs than the policies sold under Affordable Care Act rules.\n\nThe bill also would permit states to make sweeping changes to insurance market rules, which would allow insurers to offer very skimpy plans that don’t come with a basic set of guaranteed benefits and that could exclude treatments and medicines for people with high-cost ailments.\n\nAlthough insurers would still be forbidden to reject customers with pre-existing conditions or charge them higher rates ― as is the case under the Affordable Care Act ― relaxing the benefit rules and introducing plans that require patients to pay more out-of-pocket would make the coverage less valuable, especially to people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nThe Senate bill would undo the Affordable Care Act’s expansion of Medicaid and end the current open-ended federal commitment to pay more than half the expense of covering any eligible Medicaid enrollee. Instead, federal Medicaid funding would be capped at a flat amount per person or a flat amount per state, based on a state’s preference, that would grow more slowly than current Medicaid spending and more slowly than rising health care costs overall.\n\n“We sincerely hope that the Senate will take this opportunity to change the course of the current debate and work to fix problems with the current system. We believe that Congress should be working to increase the number of Americans with access to quality, affordable health insurance instead of pursuing policies that have the opposite effect, and we renew our commitment to work with you in that endeavor,” the AMA’s letter concludes.\n\nAlso on Monday, the National Association of Medicaid Directors, which represents the state officials who oversee the program, rejected the Medicaid components of the Senate bill.\n\nThe legislation would give states greater leeway to decide who is eligible for Medicaid and what benefits the program must cover, but these regulators argue that flexibility doesn’t make up for the much lower funding amounts. Several governors have expressed similar concerns.\n\n“No amount of administrative or regulatory flexibility can compensate for the federal spending reductions that would occur as a result of this bill,” the Medicaid officials said in a statement.\n\n“Changes in the federal responsibility for financing the program must be accompanied by clearly articulated statutory changes to Medicaid to enable states to operate effectively under a cap,” they went on. “The Senate bill does not accomplish that. It would be a transfer of risk, responsibility, and cost to the states of historic proportions.”\n\nThe National Governors Association, which represents state chief executives from both parties, also weighed in on the Senate bill Monday, urging McConnell to slow down.\n\n“Governors must be given adequate time to determine the impact any health care bill will have on their states and residents, and ensure that the bill does not adversely harm the people we were elected to serve,” Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) and Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker (R) wrote to McConnell on behalf of all 50 governors. “We urge you to give states sufficient time to review the legislation before proceeding, so that the full impact of the legislation may be understood and explained to the American people.”\n\nNumerous other health care groups also have misgivings or are outright opposed to passage of the Senate health care bill.

A total of 600 high rises across Britain are due to be tested.\n\n“The fact that all samples so far have failed the test underlines the value of the testing programme and the vital importance of submitting samples urgently,” he said, adding the lab can test 100 samples a day and runs around the clock.\n\nHe added: “Building Regulations and the system for ensuring fire safety in buildings have been developed over many decades.\n\n“And until the Grenfell Fire many experts would have claimed that system has served us well.\n\n“But now we have witnessed a catastrophic failure, on a scale many thought impossible in 21st century Britain.”\n\nPA Wire/PA Images Sajid Javid: 'We have witnessed a catastrophic failure, on a scale many thought impossible in 21st century Britain'.\n\nJavid’s statement to the Commons comes after Camden Council evacuated five of its high rises blocks on Friday evening, saying it would put up residents elsewhere while urgent work was done to make them safe.\n\nWhile the council was initially accused of overreacting, Javid praised its action, saying: “Landlords must keep residential buildings safe for their tenants.\n\n“Where they cannot satisfy that obligation with appropriate mitigating measures, we expect alternative accommodation to be provided while remedial work is carried out.\n\n“That is exactly what has happened in Camden and I’d like to pay tribute to the residents there for their brave response in such a distressing situation.”\n\nJUSTIN TALLIS via Getty Images People leave a high rise on the Chalcots Estate on Friday evening, after Camden Council ordered the evacuation of five tower blocks\n\nJohn Healey, Javid’s Labour shadow, responded by hitting out at why only 75 had been tested in the nearly two weeks since the fire.\n\nHe said: “Ministers talk too loosely about the ‘buildings or tower blocks tested’ or so far.

And there’s nothing wrong with that - as long as we know life is usually more complicated than a Gary Cooper movie.\n\nRecommending a making-of-the-movie book as more interesting than the film it explores is a compliment to the author. And in the case of this 1942 biopic about baseball great Lou Gehrig, an acknowledgement that time can be cruel to our youthful favorites.\n\n“The Pride of the Yankees” is best remembered for Cooper re-enacting Gehrig’s farewell speech at Yankee Stadium. In 1939 the slugger and first baseman was dying of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a nerve disease soon to carry his name. His oft-quoted observation - “Today, I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth” - set the standard for self-effacing courage.\n\nWhen Hollywood got involved in Gehrig’s story, accuracy was destined to strike out. As author Richard Sandomir explains, producer Sam Goldwyn saw a Gehrig movie in terms of typical entertainment of the period: a portrait of a heroic figure with touches of humor and romance. For Goldwyn, the element of baseball was something to be “put up with.”\n\nThe studio publicity machine created a phony tale of a national search for the right person, whether actor or athlete, to play Gehrig. (Imagine Cary Grant, Spencer Tracy or Ronald Reagan in pinstripes.) It was all about ballyhoo because Cooper was under contract to Goldwyn and owed him a picture.\n\nTicket sales and 11 Oscar nominations (it would win for film editing) proved Goldwyn was right to steer clear, for the most part, of baseball action scenes. Viewed today, however, the film can come off as a syrupy blend of cliches, falling short of the enduring charm of “Casablanca” and a handful of other wartime films.\n\nNot that Sandomir sees it that way. Overall, he still judges “The Pride of the Yankees” to be a classic that’s true in spirit to its subject. But that pitch is batted away by the very elements that make his book worth reading. The New York Times writer researched Gehrig’s life and the story behind the movie to provide an authoritative take on what’s factual (not that much), what’s fanciful (a whole lot) and what’s a bit of both.\n\nThe Montana-born Cooper, more at home on the range than at home plate, needed lots of batting instruction, most of it taking place behind his Los Angeles mansion. One tale has it that he broke a window at neighbor Tyrone Power’s house - twice. But Sandomir refutes the folklore that all baseball scenes featuring the right-handed Cooper were reversed so he would better resemble the lefty Gehrig. Some cinematic chicanery did take place, just not nearly as much as some have said, and Cooper managed to learn to throw with his left.\n\nA heart-tugging moment in the film comes when an ailing Gehrig, waiting for his turn at bat, realizes he can’t cut it anymore and takes himself out of the lineup, causing a shock wave in the stadium. In reality, Gehrig decided the night before and told his manager the next day. The crowd knew before the first pitch.\n\nAnd then there’s the speech. Sandomir points out that newspapers published different versions of Gehrig’s farewell and that no complete newsreel of it exists. In real life, the famous line comes near the beginning of his remarks. In reel life, Cooper speaks the line at the end - the filmmakers knew a good wrap-up when they heard one.\n\nThe movie plays down the nasty relationship between Gehrig’s mother and his wife, who traded accusations about who was responsible for his illness. It also gets wrong little details - dates, stats, lineups - that suggest simple cinema sloppiness.\n\nIf none of that really matters, then Sandomir’s dogged efforts to separate fact and fiction make for one big whiff. More likely, fans of film and baseball will appreciate his book as a welcome counterbalance to feel-good Hollywood mythmaking.\n\n___\n\nDouglass K.

Pepe the Frog is coming back from the dead.\n\nLos Angeles-based cartoonist Matt Furie told The Associated Press on Monday that he intends to resurrect the character he killed off last month in what appeared to be a rebuke to racist, anti-Semitic internet trolls who hijacked his creation, transforming it into a hate symbol.\n\nFurie and his brother, Jason, launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise $10,000 for a new comic book featuring Pepe. He also has an attorney, Kimberly Motley, exploring possible litigation against those profiting off Pepe’s image without Furie’s permission.\n\nA cartoon released in May showed Pepe in an open casket. Furie said he created that cartoon as “art therapy” shortly after November’s presidential election and nearly forgot about it.\n\nFurie said he was surprised by the wave of publicity generated by Pepe’s “death.”\n\n“It was supposed to just be a joke,” he said.\n\nThe “Save Pepe” campaign that Furie launched Monday on Kickstarter says its aim is “reclaiming his status as a universal symbol for peace, love, and acceptance.” If the campaign meets its goal, Furie said he would see that as “proof that Pepe is still a positive thing.”\n\nFurie’s “chill frog-dude” debuted in a 2006 comic book called “Boy’s Club.” Pepe’s likeness became a popular canvas for benevolent internet memes.\n\nBut the user-generated mutations became increasingly hateful and ubiquitous more than a year before the 2016 presidential election. Furie was horrified to see his creation become a mascot for the “alt-right” fringe movement, a loosely connected mix of white nationalists, neo-Nazis and other right-wing extremists.\n\n“It all just happened so fast,” he said. “Make no mistake: They’re basically the new (Ku Klux Klan).”\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League branded Pepe as a hate symbol in September 2016 and promoted Furie’s efforts to reclaim the character.\n\nFurie said his plans for Pepe’s resurrection - in the first “Boy’s Club” comic book since 2010 - are top secret.\n\n“Once we get the money together, we’re going to do it from scratch,” he said.\n\nIn the meantime, Furie said he’s also trying to “gain some entrepreneurial control” over Pepe with his attorney’s help.\n\n“It’s a very American tale, trying to control that which cannot be controlled,” he said.\n\nMotley, Furie’s Milwaukee-based lawyer, said all of the characters in his comic book are copyright-protected. She said she is still in “research mode” and hasn’t sued anyone yet for using Pepe’s image without permission to sell merchandise such as T-shirts, posters and hats.\n\n“This isn’t about crushing people’s rights to free speech,” she said. “This is about taking Pepe back to where he belongs as a positive image.”	2017-06-26 23:34:21.459978+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	6	1080	['The Washington Times Http', 'Michael Kunzelman']

The FBI website estimates billions of dollars are lost every year repairing systems attacked by cybercrime.\n\nThe university’s two-year cybersecurity and information assurance program covers how to prevent a hack and requires students to be familiar with networks, software and server administration.\n\n“The internet as we know it is still a wide-open frontier filled with lawlessness much as was seen in the early days of pioneers and cattle drives of the wild west,” said Ivy Tech Community College student Dave Houchin. The 34-year-old expects to earn his degree in the program later this year.\n\n“It is an exponentially growing career choice,” he said. “Demand for services, such as securing and maintaining networks, will only increase.”\n\nThere are almost 630 annual job openings in cybersecurity in the state, according to the 2014-2024 Department of Workforce Development and Bureau of Labor Statistics Occupational Demand Report.\n\nIndiana State University will soon offer a cybersecurity studies program that will focus on human mistakes that can lead to security breaches. It will look at training programs to make employees more aware of phishing emails so they don’t create a security breach, said Indiana State assistant professor Bill Mackey.\n\n“We’re teaching them how to be a human anti-virus,” he said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Tribune-Star, http://www.tribstar.com	2017-06-26 23:35:08.50658+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	6	1091	['The Washington Times Http']

JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) - The Missouri NAACP issued an advisory that tells travelers to be careful while in the state because of a danger that civil rights won’t be respected, state chapter President Rod Chapel said Monday.\n\nThe advisory cites a bill passed by lawmakers this year that would make it more difficult to sue for housing or employment discrimination. The legislation is on the desk of Republican Gov. Eric Greitens, who has not said whether he’ll sign the bill but has supported other efforts to rein in lawsuits in an attempt to improve the legal climate for businesses in the state.\n\nA spokesman for the governor didn’t immediately comment Monday.\n\nThe state NAACP has strongly criticized the legislation, which Chapel said could make it tougher to hold people accountable for harassment and discrimination against women, people with disabilities and others.\n\n“At this point, I think everybody’s‘ civil rights are now in jeopardy,” he said.\n\nSome Republican lawmakers and supporters including the Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry argued the change will help to reduce the number of “frivolous lawsuits” they say have made it challenging to do business in the state.\n\nChapel said the advisory follows a “culmination of issues that are critical to civil rights in Missouri.” Other issues cited in the advisory include a recent attorney general’s report that shows black Missouri drivers last year were 75 percent more likely to be stopped than whites.\n\nChapel also said the organization’s state chapter is considering a full boycott, a tactic that’s been used against other states that have adopted conservative policies.\n\nThe NAACP in February launched an economic boycott in North Carolina over the state’s so-called bathroom bill as well as ongoing legal fights over voting rights. In May, the American Civil Liberties Union issued a warning about traveling to Texas because of the state’s new law banning so-called sanctuary cities.\n\nThe Missouri NAACP and other opponents of the bill on discrimination are rallying Tuesday at the Capitol to urge Greitens to veto the legislation.	2017-06-26 23:35:28.989315+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	6	1098	['The Washington Times Http', 'Summer Ballentine']

WASHINGTON (AP) - The Supreme Court is rejecting yet another call to decide whether Americans have a constitutional right to carry guns with them outside their homes.\n\nThe justices on Monday left in place an appeals court ruling that upheld the San Diego sheriff’s strict limits on issuing permits for concealed weapons.\n\nThe high court decided in 2008 that the Constitution guarantees the right to a gun, at least for self-defense at home.\n\nBut the justices have refused repeated pleas to spell out the extent of gun rights in the United States, allowing permit restrictions and assault weapons bans to remain in effect in some cities and states.\n\nMore than 40 states already broadly allow gun owners to be armed in public.\n\nJustices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch said the court should have reviewed the appellate ruling. Thomas said the decision not to hear the case “reflects a distressing trend: the treatment of the Second Amendment as a disfavored right.”\n\nThe high court also turned away a second case involving guns and the federal law that bars people convicted of crimes from owning guns.\n\nThe Trump administration had urged the court to review an appellate ruling that restored the rights of two men who had been convicted of non-violent crimes to own guns.\n\nThe federal appeals court in Philadelphia ruled for the two men. The crimes were classified as misdemeanors, which typically are less serious, but carried potential prison sentences of more than a year. Such prison terms typically are for felonies, more serious crimes.\n\nThe administration says that the court should have upheld the blanket prohibition on gun ownership in the federal law and rejected case-by-case challenges.\n\nJustices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor said they would have heard the administration’s appeal.\n\nDaniel Binderup of Manheim, Pennsylvania, was 41 when he pleaded guilty to “corruption of minors” after acknowledging that he had been involved in a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old employee of his bakery business. The crime is a misdemeanor yet carries with it a maximum prison term of five years, although Binderup was given probation instead of time behind bars.\n\nJulio Suarez was convicted in Maryland of carrying a handgun without a license, a misdemeanor with a possible prison term of up to three years.

HAMILTON, Bermuda (AP) - Redemption for a gutty crew of five New Zealanders and one Australian came on the turquoise waters of Bermuda’s Great Sound, four years and 3,000 miles removed from one of the most brutal collapses in sports.\n\nWith a mixture of ingenuity and national pride, Emirates Team New Zealand got back up after a gut punch for the ages and came to the Bermuda Triangle and ripped the America’s Cup right out of tech tycoon Larry Ellison’s hands.\n\n“We’re on top of the world,” helmsman Peter Burling said Monday after steering the Kiwis’ incredibly fast 50-foot foiling catamaran to the clinching victory in the 7-1 rout of two-time defending champion Oracle Team USA.\n\nAs soon as the red-and-black Kiwi cat crossed the finish line, the normally reserved crew began whooping and jumped up onto the trampoline netting and into a joyful group hug.\n\nMagnums of champagne arrived and Burling and crewman Blair Tuke, who won Olympic gold and silver medals together, sprayed the crew. They later enjoyed beers together before going ashore.\n\nAbout an hour later, with the America’s Cup set on a podium, Burling and Ashby grabbed it together and lifted it over their heads. As the silver trophy was passed around, some team members poured champagne into it and took swigs.\n\nAt 26, Burling becomes the youngest helmsman to win sailing’s greatest prize in a competition that dates to 1851.\n\nThe only non-Kiwi on the crew is Australian Glenn Ashby, 39, a multihull wiz and Olympic silver medalist who serves as skipper and controls the space-age wingsail.\n\nThere were no Americans on Oracle Team USA’s crew, which included five Australians and one from Antigua.\n\nEllison, the Silicon Valley maverick worth an estimated $62 billion, watched the humbling defeat from a chase boat and later shook hands with his crew. He was joined by New Zealander Russell Coutts, the CEO of Oracle Team USA who suffered his first defeat in six Americas Cup finals. It was Coutts who first won the America’s Cup for the small sailing-mad island nation, skippering Team New Zealand to a five-race sweep of Dennis Conner off San Diego in 1995.\n\nTeam New Zealand started this match with a negative point because Oracle won the qualifiers, forcing the Kiwis to win eight races to return the Auld Mug to the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron in Auckland for the first time since 2003.\n\nIt was sweet atonement for the Kiwis. In 2013 on San Francisco Bay, Team New Zealand, then led by Dean Barker, reached match point at 8-1. Oracle then staged one of the biggest comebacks in sports, winning eight straight races to retain the Auld Mug.\n\nAshby is the only member of the sailing crew who returned from that collapse.\n\n“It was absolutely brutal for the team. It was a hard pill to swallow,” Ashby said. “For myself and a lot of the other guys that are with the team this time around, it is a great redemption and just a relief to right the wrongs of the last campaign. We obviously learned a lot from that campaign.\n\n“For all the guys involved, I think there will be a lot of proud yachties from New Zealand, a lot of proud Kiwis today with what’s been achieved over the past few years.”\n\nThousands of sleepy New Zealanders got up at 5 a.m. to watch the race on television.\n\n“It’s David and Goliath. We beat the biggest and the best in the world, so that’s just fabulous,” said Roger Foley, who watched with dozens of others at the Royal Port Nicholson Yacht Club in the capital, Wellington.\n\nMany felt relief as well as elation after the heartbreak of the 2013 campaign.\n\nThe nation’s Prime Minister, Bill English, posted a short video of himself celebrating at home: “We are so proud of you,” he wrote on Twitter.\n\nThe Kiwis’ fast boat was powered by a revolutionary grinding system in which they replaced traditional arm power with leg power. They installed four stationary bikes in each hull, with the “cyclors” powering the hydraulic systems used to trim the wingsail and control the daggerboards that are tipped with hydrofoils.\n\nAmong the crew was Simon van Velthooven, who won a bronze medal in track cycling at the London Olympics.\n\n“We knew with this format that we had to be extremely innovative and extremely aggressive with our design philosophy,” Ashby said. “We sort of all as a group agreed and recognized, I guess, where the bar will eventually get with our sport and we tried to fast-track that learning process as fast as we could.\n\n“It was a big risk, I guess, but we knew we had to risk in order to ultimately win this America’s Cup.”\n\nIn Race 9, skipper Jimmy Spithill put Oracle in the lead rounding the first mark. But the faster Kiwi cat overhauled the American-flagged boat and sailed into the lead on the downwind second leg. The Kiwis won by 55 seconds.\n\nIn 2010, Spithill became the youngest skipper to win the America’s Cup, at 30. That was the first of two Cup victories for Ellison.\n\n“Full credit to Team New Zealand. I mean, man, what a series,” said Spithill, an Australian. “They made fewer mistakes and they fully deserve it so our hats are off to them.”\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Nick Perry in Wellington, New Zealand, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow Bernie Wilson on Twitter at http://twitter.com/berniewilson	2017-06-26 23:35:19.555741+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	6	1094	['The Washington Times Http', 'Bernie Wilson']

SEATTLE (AP) - Before June 24, 1947, terms such as UFOs and flying saucers had not entered popular vocabulary. Then, on that afternoon 70 years ago, it all changed because of Kenneth Arnold:\n\n“Supersonic Flying Saucers Sighted by Idaho Pilot.”\n\nArnold reported seeing near Mount Rainier nine “circular-type” objects flying in formation at more than twice the speed of sound.\n\nHis was the first widely reported UFO sighting in this country, and it set off a wave of other reported sightings.\n\nIn a now-declassified document, the Air Force Materiel Command wrote it off: “The report cannot bear even superficial examination, therefore, must be disregarded.”\n\nAnother Air Force document concluded, “It is the Air Force conclusion that the objects of this sighting were due to a mirage.”\n\nFor Arnold, it stung.\n\nHe didn’t consider himself some kind of kook. He had over 4,000 hours of mountain high-altitude pilot time; he was in the Idaho search and rescue.\n\n“I have been subjected to ridicule, much loss of time and money, newspaper notoriety, magazine stories, reflections on my honesty, my character, my business dealings,” Arnold wrote in his 1952 book, “Coming of the Saucers.”\n\nA long time ago, in 1977, I interviewed Arnold after reaching him by phone.\n\nHe died in 1984 at age 68, and in all those years, and with me, he never wavered in his descriptions.\n\n“I made my report because I thought it was my duty. It was the only proper and American thing to do. I saw what I saw,” he said.\n\nYou can draw a direct line between what Arnold repeatedly recounted in detail to FBI and military investigators and our collective fascination with the possibility that aliens have visited us.\n\nThat direct connection goes from Area 51 allegedly hiding an alien craft, to the Roswell UFO Incident; and from movies such as “Close Encounters of the Third Kind,” to the TV series “The X-Files.”\n\nIt’s become so much a part of our culture that even the CIA website has a section titled “Take a Peek Into Our “X-Files” that is chock-full of declassified files.\n\nThe CIA helpfully lists “Top 5 CIA Documents Mulder Would Love To Get His Hands On,” and “Top 5 CIA Documents Scully Would Love To Get Her Hands On.”\n\nInterested in a 1952 drawing of “flying saucers over Belgian Congo uranium mines?” It’s in the CIA files.\n\nUnassuming salesman\n\nArnold was an unlikely candidate to become embroiled in such a controversy.\n\nHe lived in Meridian, Idaho, and sold fire-extinguishing equipment. About as unusual as his life got was that he piloted a small airplane to get to his clients around the Northwest.\n\nA month after Arnold was in the news, a now-declassified report made in July 1947 by Army Air Force Counter-Intelligence Corps Officer Frank M. Brown said, “Mr. Arnold is a man of 32 years of age, being married and the father of two children . It is the personal opinion of the interviewer that Mr. Arnold actually saw what he saw . To go further, if Mr. Arnold can write a report of the character that he did while not having seen the objects that he claimed he saw, it is the opinion of the interviewer that Mr. Arnold is in the wrong business, that he should be writing Buck Rogers fiction.”\n\nThat was one of the few sympathetic portrayals in government documents of Arnold’s sighting.\n\nIn another declassified intelligence report in July 1947, First Lt. Hal L. Eustace of the Army Air Corps put Arnold’s report as part of “silly-season episodes.”\n\nThe lieutenant wrote that Arnold “seems to be reasonably well balanced, although excitable, and has no apparent ulterior motive . other than to prove he is not ‘nuts.’?”\n\nThe lieutenant wrote that Arnold revealed “an antagonistic attitude toward the Army” by stating, “Well, if the Army doesn’t know what they are, it sure ought to be trying to find out!”\n\nBright flash lit the sky\n\nArnold’s sighting of the craft was the 1947 version of a story going viral.\n\n“It was a beautiful day. Just as clear as a bell,” Arnold said. He was flying from Chehalis to Yakima and decided to spend an hour or so searching for a downed C-46 Marine transport that had crashed into the southwest side of Mount Rainier.\n\nThere was a $5,000 reward for finding it.\n\nIt was at 3 p.m., he remembered, “when a very bright flash lit up the plane and the sky around me.”\n\nAt first, Arnold thought it was the sun reflecting off another plane.\n\n“But the flash happened again, and that’s when I saw where it was coming from. It came spasmodically from a chain of nine circular-type aircraft way up from the vicinity of Mount Rainier,” said Arnold.\n\n“. I could not find any tails on these things. They didn’t leave a jet trail behind them. I judged their size to be at least 100 feet in widespan. I thought it was a new type of missile.”\n\nHis plane had a big sweep 24-hour clock on the instrument panel. Arnold measured that the craft covered the distance between Mount Rainier and Mount Adams in 1 minute 42 seconds.\n\n“That figured out to something like 1,760 miles an hour, which I could hardly believe. I knew that figure couldn’t be entirely accurate, but I’d say it was within a couple of hundred miles accurate,” he said.\n\nFrom Yakima, Arnold then flew to an air show in Pendleton, Oregon. The next day, on June 25, he stopped by the local newspaper, the East Oregonian. He wanted to know if the military had been testing secret warplanes in the area.\n\nHe ended up talking to reporter Bill Bequette, who, in subsequent years, remembered that Arnold “came off as honest, level headed and credible,” said a story in the East Oregonian.\n\nSo Bequette wrote a brief story about what Arnold said he witnessed.\n\nBut the brief also went out to The Associated Press, got picked up by numerous newspapers, and the furor began. For the first time, a mass-media story and subsequent headlines used the term, “flying saucers.”\n\nThere were no reported riches for Arnold because of his notoriety. Instead, he complained to Frank Brown, the Air Force investigator, “that his business had suffered greatly . at every stop in his business routes, large groups of people were waiting to question him .”\n\nBrown concluded his report, “Mr. Arnold stated further that if he, at any time in the future, saw anything in the sky, to quote Mr. Arnold . ‘If I ever saw a ten story building flying through the air I would never say a word about it,’ due to the fact that he has been ridiculed by the press to such an extent that he is practically a moron in the eye of the majority of the population of the United States.”\n\nA mystery to this day\n\nDespite that statement to Brown, in the coming years Arnold was driven to prove he was right.\n\nThere were “many long hours of fruitless flying with a camera, trying and failing to find anything like his saucers again,” says Martin Shough, a well-regarded researcher of the UFO phenomena who has written a detailed analysis of Arnold’s account.\n\nIn an email, Shough, who lives in the Highlands of Scotland, says, “I am resigned to never knowing what Arnold saw.”\n\nHe concludes, “Seventy years on, when so much of the flying saucer mythology that Kenneth Arnold triggered has been explained away, it is somewhat embarrassing that Arnold’s own sighting remains obstinately resistant.\n\n“But there it is.”	2017-06-26 23:36:09.133179+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	6	1107	['The Washington Times Http', 'Erik Lacitis']

1453	Coal on the rise in China, U.S. and India after major 2016 drop		http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2017/06/26/Global_Coal_17441.jpg-38040.jpg	http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jun/26/coal-rise-china-us-and-india-after-major-2016-drop/	\N	The U.S., China and India combined produce about two-thirds of the coal mined worldwide, and the latter two nations also import coal to meet demand.\nChina, India and the U.S. produce almost half of global greenhouse gas emissions.\nDespite the announced cancellation or suspension of 100 coal plants, others remain under construction, meaning consumption of coal for power will continue to rise, Zhou said.\nIn India, where 70 percent of electricity comes from coal, production has long been increasing in defiance of global trends.\nBut he noted that many existing coal plants will continue operating for years to come.	BEIJING (AP) — The world’s biggest coal users — China, the United States and India — have boosted coal mining in 2017, in an abrupt departure from last year’s record global decline for the heavily polluting fuel and a setback to efforts to rein in climate change emissions.\n\nMining data reviewed by The Associated Press show that production through May is up by at least 121 million tons, or 6 percent, for the three countries compared to the same period last year. The change is most dramatic in the U.S., where coal mining rose 19 percent in the first five months of the year, according to U.S. Department of Energy data.\n\nCoal’s fortunes had appeared to hit a new low less than two weeks ago, when British energy company BP reported that tonnage mined worldwide fell 6.5 percent in 2016, the largest drop on record. China and the U.S. accounted for almost all the decline, while India showed a slight increase.\n\nThe reasons for this year’s turnaround include policy shifts in China, changes in U.S. energy markets and India’s continued push to provide electricity to more of its poor, industry experts said. President Donald Trump’s role as coal’s booster-in-chief in the U.S. has played at most a minor role, they said.\n\nThe fuel’s popularity waned over the past several years as renewable power and natural gas made gains and China moved to curb dangerous levels of urban smog from burning coal.\n\nWhether coal’s comeback proves lasting has significant implications for long-term emission reduction targets, and for environmentalists’ hopes that China and India could emerge as leaders in battling climate change.\n\nWhile the U.S. reversal is expected to prove temporary, analysts agree that India’s use of coal will continue to grow. They’re divided on the forecast for China over the next decade.\n\nIndustry representatives say the mining resurgence underscores coal’s continued importance in power generation, though analysts caution its long-term growth prospects remain bleak.\n\nThe U.S., China and India combined produce about two-thirds of the coal mined worldwide, and the latter two nations also import coal to meet demand. India’s production expanded even during coal’s global downturn.\n\n“If you look at those three countries, everyone else is irrelevant in the scheme of things,” said Tim Buckley, energy finance director for the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.\n\nBurning coal for power, manufacturing and heat is a primary source of the carbon dioxide emissions that scientists say is driving climate change. Reducing such emissions was a critical piece of the 2015 Paris climate accord that Trump announced this month he wants to exit.\n\nAlmost every other nation continues to support the deal, including China and India. China, India and the U.S. produce almost half of global greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nCoal accounts for almost half of greenhouse emissions from burning fossil fuels, according to the Global Carbon Project. China is by far the world’s largest coal user, consuming half the global supply.\n\nChina has committed to capping its greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, and some have suggested it might accomplish that up to a decade earlier. Xizhou Zhou, a senior energy analyst with IHS Markit based in Beijing, said the recent uptick in coal production that the AP identified raises doubts about such optimism, but he added that China is still expected to meet its 2030 deadline.\n\n“Coal consumption will continue to increase, mainly driven by Asian countries,” Zhou said. “We’re seeing a recovery starting this year and an increase until the mid-2020s before you see coal plateau globally.”\n\nChina’s production rose more than 4 percent through May, according to government figures, compared to a drop of more than 8 percent for the same period a year earlier.\n\nHundreds of mines shut down in China last year and the government forced others to cut back hours in a bid to reduce an oversupply of coal and boost prices. The government has since relaxed that policy and production is rebounding.\n\nAlso, as China continues to recover from a 2015 economic slowdown, it’s seeing increased manufacturing and new investments in roads, bridges and other projects. That creates more demand for electricity, most of which continues to come from coal even after huge Chinese investments in wind and solar power.\n\nDespite the announced cancellation or suspension of 100 coal plants, others remain under construction, meaning consumption of coal for power will continue to rise, Zhou said. Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam and Pakistan also are building new plants.\n\nIn India, where 70 percent of electricity comes from coal, production has long been increasing in defiance of global trends. The country has long argued it has both a right and an obligation to expand power generation as it extends electricity access to hundreds of millions of people who still have none. India also is seeking to reduce its reliance on imported coal by mining more of its own reserves.\n\nAn AP review of reports from the Coal Ministry of India found that mining among state-owned companies, which comprise the overwhelming majority of the nation’s production, grew 4 percent in the first five months of this year.\n\nIn the U.S., the bulk of the increase occurred in major coal-producing states including Wyoming, Pennsylvania and West Virginia.\n\nPrices for natural gas, a competing fuel in power generation, edged up in early 2017, helping coal, said Andy Roberts of the consulting firm Wood Mackenzie. That’s expected to be a temporary boost given the nation’s huge natural gas supplies. A cold winter in parts of the U.S. also benefited coal by increasing power demand.\n\nWorld Coal Association Chief Executive Officer Benjamin Sporton acknowledged that it’s been “a difficult few years for coal” but argued that the market remains strong, particularly in China and India.\n\n“All the signs point to (a) positive upward trend,” Sporton told the AP.\n\nStill, coal’s dominant role in providing electricity has been eroding. China now has more renewable energy than any other nation. Its Communist Party leaders have vowed to invest $360 billion in the sector through 2020.\n\nIndia’s government has said it needs no more coal-powered power plants and last month canceled 13.7 gigawatts in proposed plants, enough to power more than 10 million homes if the plants ran at full capacity. It has promoted renewables with a raft of incentives and declared that power from some solar installations should be used first when demand goes up.\n\nAnalysts said India is struggling to adjust to what appears to be a “new normal” — with its growth in electricity capacity outstripping the rise in demand. Manufacturing has not grown as quickly as hoped, and though transmission is steadily expanding to reach more households, 260 million Indians are still off-grid.\n\nAs a result, the country’s power plants are running at below 60 percent of capacity on average — down from 2009, when India was using 75 percent of its capacity.\n\n“The private sector is not undertaking any new investment in thermal energy” such as coal plants, said Ashok Khurana, director general of the Association of Power Producers in India. “There’s no sense in it.”\n\nTrump’s advocacy for reviving the coal-mining industry stands as an exception among the three nations’ leaders. Yet the U.S. also is where coal’s rebound could be briefest.\n\nCheap natural gas, a growing appetite for renewable energy and stricter pollution rules spurred utilities to shut down or announce retirements for several hundred U.S. coal plants. U.S. utilities that invested heavily in alternatives are considered unlikely to revert to coal, Roberts said, meaning market forces and not Trump’s politics will play the biggest role in determining the industry’s future.\n\nBuckley, the energy finance specialist, said he expects the mining increases of 2017 to emerge as an anomaly and global declines will soon resume. But he noted that many existing coal plants will continue operating for years to come.\n\n“We’re not talking about the end of coal tomorrow or the end of coal next decade. We’re talking about a 40-year transition,” he said.\n\n__\n\nDaigle reported from New Delhi.	2017-06-26 23:36:16.845602+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	6	1109	['The Washington Times Http', 'Matthew Brown', 'Katy Daigle']

1455	Donald Trump eager for big meeting with Vladimir Putin; some advisers wary		http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2017/06/26/Trump_Russia_Meeting_40653.jpg-16bc5.jpg	http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jun/26/donald-trump-eager-big-meeting-vladimir-putin-some/	\N	WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is eager to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin with full diplomatic bells and whistles when the two are in Germany for a multinational summit next month.\nMany administration officials believe the U.S. needs to maintain its distance from Russia at such a sensitive time — and interact only with great caution.\nBut Trump and some others within his administration have been pressing for a full bilateral meeting.\nThere are potential benefits to a meeting with Putin.\nTrump has to directly “say to Putin, ‘We’re not happy about you interfering in our election,’” said Steven Pifer, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.	WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is eager to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin with full diplomatic bells and whistles when the two are in Germany for a multinational summit next month. But the idea is exposing deep divisions within the administration on the best way to approach Moscow in the midst of an ongoing investigation into Russian meddling in the U.S. elections.\n\nMany administration officials believe the U.S. needs to maintain its distance from Russia at such a sensitive time — and interact only with great caution.\n\nBut Trump and some others within his administration have been pressing for a full bilateral meeting. He’s calling for media access and all the typical protocol associated with such sessions, even as officials within the State Department and National Security Council urge more restraint, according to a current and a former administration official.\n\nSome advisers have recommended that the president instead do either a quick, informal “pull-aside” on the sidelines of the summit, or that the U.S. and Russian delegations hold “strategic stability talks,” which typically don’t involve the presidents. The officials spoke anonymously to discuss private policy discussions.\n\nThe contrasting views underscore differing views within the administration on overall Russia policy, and Trump’s eagerness to develop a working relationship with Russia despite the ongoing investigations.\n\nThere are potential benefits to a meeting with Putin. A face-to-face meeting can humanize the two sides and often removes some of the intrigue involved in impersonal, telephone communication. Trump — the ultimate dealmaker — has repeatedly suggested that he can replace the Obama-era damage in the U.S.-Russia relationship with a partnership, particularly on issues like the ongoing Syria conflict.\n\nThere are big risks, though. Trump is known to veer off-script, creating the possibility for a high-stakes diplomatic blunder. In a brief Oval Office meeting with top Russian diplomats last month, Trump revealed highly classified information about an Islamic State group threat to airlines that was relayed to him by Israel, according to a senior administration official. The White House defended the disclosures as “wholly appropriate.”\n\nIn addition, many observers warn that Putin is not to be trusted.\n\nOleg Kalugin, a former general with Russia’s main security agency, known as the KGB, said Putin, a shrewd and experienced politician, has “other priorities” than discussing the accusations that Russia hacked the U.S. election with Trump, such as easing sanctions, raising oil prices, as well as next year’s presidential elections in Russia.\n\n“Putin knows how to redirect a conversation in his favor,” Kalugin said.\n\nNina Khrushcheva, a Russian affairs professor at the New School, said Trump is in an “impossible position.”\n\n“He can’t be too nice to Putin because it’s going to be interpreted in a way that suggests he has a special relationship with Russia,” she said. “He can’t be too mean because Putin has long arms and KGB thinking. So Trump needs to have a good relationship with him but he also needs to fulfill his campaign promises of establishing better relations with Russia.”\n\nThe White House said no final decision has been made about whether a meeting will take place. It did not respond to questions about the opposing views within the administration.\n\nBilateral meetings are common during summits like the G20, where many world leaders and their advisers are gathered in one place. The meetings are typically highly choreographed affairs, with everything from the way the two leaders shake hands to the looks that they exchange and the actual words spoken offering glimpses into the state of affairs.\n\nThe last U.S.-Russia bilateral meeting was a 2015 encounter between Putin and President Barack Obama that began with an awkward handshake and ended with progress on the brutal civil war in Syria.\n\nThat 2015 meeting, the first in two years, involved a 90-minute sit-down at U.N. headquarters. Putin and U.S. officials later said the two leaders had made progress on issues related to Syria, which had strained their already tense relationship. For the Obama administration, cautious engagement was the name of the game, with the U.S. working tirelessly to find middle ground with Moscow on Syria, Ukraine and other issues.\n\nThe disconnect between Trump and his advisers in the State Department and National Security Council over Russia runs deeper than the debate over a G20 bilateral.\n\nA former administration official who spoke anonymously to discuss classified information said that frustration is growing among foreign policy advisers over the failure of the White House to embrace a more cautious and critical approach to Russia. All 17 U.S. intelligence agencies have agreed Russia was behind last year’s hack of Democratic email systems and tried to influence the 2016 election to benefit Trump.\n\nTrump has to directly “say to Putin, ‘We’re not happy about you interfering in our election,’” said Steven Pifer, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. “If you don’t say that, you are going to get hammered by the press and Congress and you can guarantee Congress will pass sanctions legislation against Russia.”\n\n“They also need to keep their expectations very, very modest,” added Pifer. “If they aim for a homerun in Hamburg, my guess is they’ll strike out.”	2017-06-26 23:36:26.103283+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	6	1111	['The Washington Times Http', 'Vivian Salama']

ANALYSIS/OPINION:\n\nSo LGBT pride marchers this past weekend were supposed to be marching for equal rights and tolerance and acceptance — all the things the left loves to spout as core human rights, and to claim as antithetical to what conservatives represent.\n\nBut if that’s true, if tolerance is thy LGBTers’ middle name, why were Jewish women attending the pride fest told to leave?\n\nSeems a bit — intolerant, shall we say?\n\nIn Chicago, at the annual 21st Chicago Dyke March, a handful of women told the local LGBT newspaper, the Windy City Times, they were asked to leave because the Star of David they had affixed to their rainbow banners seemed threatening.\n\nSpecifically, the Jewish women were told their flags “made people feel unsafe,” the news outlet reported.\n\nThe march organizers — after making clear they’re separate from Chicago’s Pride Parade — took to Twitter to defend their decision to boot the Jews, by saying: “During the rally, we saw three individuals carrying Israeli flags super imposed on rainbow flags. Some folks say they are Jewish Pride flags. But as a Collective, we are very much pro-Palestine, and when we see these flags we know a lot of folks who are under attack by Israel see the visuals of the flag as a threat, so we don’t want anything in the [Dyke March] space that can inadvertently or advertently express Zionism. So we asked the folks to please leave. We told them people in the space were feeling threatened.”\n\nOne of the Jewish women who was asked to leave, Laurie Grauer, told the local LGBT newspaper that she’s marched in gay pride parades in the past without problem. She also said that she actually supports the two-state solution — and that “it’s hard to swallow the idea of inclusion when you are excluding people from that.”\n\nBingo. Could you imagine a Christian pride parade-goer asking an individual carrying a rainbow flag to leave — and the mass leftist outcry that would ensue?\n\nBut this is how the left operates, via selective tolerance and inclusion.\n\nU.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said she and her son were heckled as they left a restaurant in New York City by Gay Pride Parade-goers who happened to be in the street at the time.\n\nShe tweeted: “We, incl my son, were booed by patrons saying hateful things as we left lunch @Pride Parade. Our country is better than this.”\n\nApparently — not.\n\nMuch of the pride paraders in cities around the nation took advantage of the gatherings to denounce all things President Donald Trump.\n\nFrom a Reuters report: “A group of marchers heading down New York’s Fifth Avenue carried photographs of U.S. President Donald Trump and his press secretary, Sean Spicer, as others waved banners bearing the word “RESIST’ and the rainbow flag of the Pride movement.”\n\nResist what, exactly — the way Trump fights radical Islamic terror, and the Islam belief that homosexuals ought to be thrown off rooftops or otherwise murdered for their sexual choices?\n\nThat’s the problem with the left: Their protests, very often, don’t make sense.\n\nTolerance is selective, inclusivity is exclusivity, and those who only want to help, seen as the enemies.The LGBT marches are just more evidence of this leftist insanity.	2017-06-26 23:36:45.276145+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	6	1119	['The Washington Times Http', 'Cheryl K.

ANALYSIS/OPINION:\n\nA professor of anthropology at the University of Delaware, Katherine Dettwyler, age 62, who said in a Facebook post that Otto Warmbier was a “spoiled” white boy who “got exactly what he deserved” — imprisonment in North Korea, leading to his death — has been fired.\n\nGood riddance. Don’t let the door hit you.\n\nThe firing is not really surprising. Her remarks, couched as they were in what she claimed were observances based on decades of experience as a teacher, were over-the-top and unnecessarily brutal.\n\nWarmbier, to recall, was detained by North Korean authorities for the crime of theft — of a propaganda poster — in 2016, and shortly after sentenced to 15 years of hard labor. He was finally freed and sent back to the United States, but the 17 months he had spent in jail had taken their toll. He was in a coma with severe brain damage and died on June 19.\n\nOf the incident, Dettwylerwrote on Facebook: “Is it wrong of me to think that Otto Warmbier got exactly what he deserved? He went to North Korea, for f—‘s sake, and then acted like a spoiled, naive, arrogant, US college student who had never had to face the consequences of his actions.”\n\nIs it wrong? Well, kind of. Nobody, after all, deserves to be tortured to the point of coma then death. No, not even 22-year-old white students who may be dumb, naive or any other number of unflattering names that can be affixed.\n\nShe went on: “Otto is typical of the mindset of a lot of the young, white, rich, clueles[s] males who come into my classes. These are the same kids who cry about their grades, because they didn’t think they’re really have to read and study the material to get a good grade. They simply deserve a good grade for being who they are. Or instead of crying, they bluster and threaten their female professors.”\n\nDettwyler also pointed fingers of blame at Warmbier’s parents for letting their son think “he could get away with whatever he wanted,” absent consequences.\n\n“Young, white, rich, clueless white males routinely get away with raping women” in the United States, she went on.\n\nAnd Warmbier’s alleged criminal behavior — stealing a North Korea propaganda poster — is akin to those male students in America who “think nothing of raping drunk girls at frat parties and snorting cocaine, cheating on exams and threatening professors with physical violence,” Dettwyler continued.\n\nUmm — well. It is a bit different, wouldn’t you say?\n\nStealing a poster — rape. It’s not exactly a potatoes-potatahotoes comparison.\n\nSo university officials fired her, saying she “will not be rehired to teach at the university in the future.”\n\nGood riddance. Amid all the left-leaning protests on America’s campuses — all the fires and broken glass and clashes with police and opposition to conservative speakers — and amid all the administrative tolerance for such shows of violence, it’s nice to finally see a university act swiftly and with sanity. School officials, like students, have the First Amendment right to freedom of speech. But schools have the right to react to that free speech, as well. And a professor who believes a student deserves to be imprisoned, tortured and beaten into a coma — and ultimately die — for the so-called crime of taking a poster, is simply unfit to teach.	2017-06-26 23:36:47.274668+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	6	1121	['The Washington Times Http', 'Cheryl K.

MULTAN, Pakistan (AP) — Pakistan’s prime minister cut short a trip abroad to rush to the side of victims of a massive fuel tanker fire as authorities on Monday raised the death toll from the blaze to 157.\n\nThe truck, carrying some 25,000 liters (6,600 gallons) of gasoline, was traveling from the southern port city of Karachi to Lahore, the Punjab provincial capital, when the driver lost control and crashed on a highway outside the town of Bahawalpur early on Sunday.\n\nAlerted by an announcement over a mosque loudspeaker that an overturned tanker truck was leaking fuel, scores of villagers rushed to the scene to collect the spilled fuel when the blaze ignited. The wreck had exploded, engulfing people in flames as they screamed in terror.\n\nDr. Nahid Ahmed at the Nishter Hospital in the city of Multan, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) away from the site of the fire, said four of the victims that were brought from Bahawalpur had died overnight, bringing the death toll to 157. Ahmed said 50 more severely burned victims were being treated at his hospital.\n\nRescue official Mohammad Baqar at the Bahawalpur hospital said 20 more victims were transported on Monday by a military C-130 plane to Lahore for better medical care.\n\nPrime minister Nawaz Sharif, who visited the Victoria Hospital in Bahawalpur on Monday, ordered that more of those most critically hurt be transferred to bigger hospitals in the area, Baqar said.\n\nSharif cut short his trip abroad and rushed back home, reaching Bahwalpur on Monday to visit the victims and console the affected families. Sharif also announced 2 million rupees — almost $20,000 — as financial assistance for each family that had lost a family member in the highway inferno. Sharif also handed over checks of 1 million rupees ($10,000) for each burned victim being treated at the hospital in Bahawalpur.\n\n“This is not compensation, no compensation is possible for precious human life, but it is to help the affected families in distress,” Sharif said, expressing his prayers for those killed and for a speedy recovery of the burned victims.\n\nMany of the bodies were burned beyond recognition and will have to be identified through DNA testing, Baqar said.\n\n“I have never seen anything like it in my life. Victims trapped in the fireball. They were screaming for help,” said Abdul Malik, a police officer who was among the first to arrive on the scene of horror in Pakistan’s Punjab province.\n\nWhen the flames subsided, he said, “we saw bodies everywhere. So many were just skeletons. The people who were alive were in really bad shape.”\n\nSome of the most badly burned were immediately evacuated by army helicopters to Multan. The dead included men, women and children.\n\nThe disaster struck on the eve of the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr that follows the holy month of Ramadan. While Saudi Arabia and most other Muslim countries started celebrating the holiday Sunday, Pakistanis are marking it on Monday.\n\nThe scope of Sunday’s tragedy was a first in Pakistan but in cases of massive oil leaks in impoverished countries, many of the poorest and least educated often rush to the scene to collect the spilled fuel, unaware of the grave danger they face. In recent years, such incidents have been reported in Nigeria and Sudan.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press Writer Zarar Khan in Islamabad contributed to this report.	2017-06-26 23:36:48.385578+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	6	1122	['The Washington Times Http', 'Irum Asim']

Remy Ma has ended rival Nicki Minaj’s seven-year winning streak at the 2017 BET Awards, a show highlighted by ‘90s R&B and groups popular in that decade, as well as five wins for Beyonce.\n\nMa, who was released from prison in 2014, won best female hip hop artist Sunday in Los Angeles, an award Minaj has won since 2010. Ma last won the prize in 2005, and was sentenced to prison three years later after she shot a former friend after accusing her of theft.\n\n“I wanna thank God first and foremost,” said Ma, who named two correctional facilities in her speech and thanked her mentor Fat Joe and husband-rapper Papoose. “You can make mistakes and come back.”\n\nIn March, Ma released the hostile diss track “Shether,” which earned praised from critics and rap fans. Minaj never officially responded to the song.\n\nAt the live show at the Microsoft Theater, ‘90s R&B favorites New Edition and Xscape were the most welcomed performers of the night.\n\nNew Edition, whose three-part biopic was a white-hot ratings success for BET earlier this year, earned the lifetime achievement award and received a lengthy tribute. It started with the child actors from the movie singing “Candy Girl,” later followed by the older actors for some of the band’s hits apart from the group, including Bell Biv DeVoe’s “Poison” and Ralph Tresvant’s “Sensitivity.”\n\nThe real group then hit to stage to sing “Can You Stand the Rain” and “Mr. Telephone Man.” The actors later joined New Edition for “If It Isn’t Love.”\n\nGirl group Xscape, set to launch a new reality show on Bravo, reunited at the BET Awards and sang the popular hits “Just Kickin’ It,” ”Understanding” and “Who Can I Run To?” The crowd was in awe, singing along and filming the performance with their phones.\n\nBruno Mars, whose new album was heavily inspired by ‘90s R&B, also shined Sunday. He and Beyonce tied for video of the year - the top prize but not televised - with their hits “24K Magic” and “Sorry.” Mars also won best male R&B/pop artist and kicked off the show with a fun and funky performance of the song, “Perm.”\n\n“To the fans, you know I love you. My first BET Award,” he screamed.\n\nKendrick Lamar surprised the audience when he performed with Future and won best male hip hop artist. He gave a shout-out to fellow nominee Chance the Rapper, who earned the humanitarian award at the age of 24. Chance also won best new artist and best collaboration.\n\nIn a taped message, Michelle Obama honored Chance, who has raised $2 million dollars for Chicago public schools. The former First Lady said she and Barack Obama knew Chance “since he was a baby rapper.”\n\n“Chance is showing our young people that they matter,” she said. “Because of you, countless young people will grow up believing in themselves.”\n\nBeyonce, who reportedly had her twins earlier this month though she hasn’t commented on the topic, was the top nominee with seven. When it was announced that she won the viewer’s choice award, Chloe x Halle - the young duo signed to Beyonce - recited a speech given to them from the pop star. Queen Bey was the big winner with five, also taking home album of the year for “Lemonade,” best female R&B/pop artist and video director of the year for “Sorry.”\n\nSolange, Beyonce’s younger sister, also had a big night: She won the Centric award and called Sunday “the best birthday ever” (she turned 31 on Saturday).\n\n“My arm pits are sweating so much right now,” said Solange, who thanked BET for showing her “queens” like Aaliyah, Missy Elliott, Erykah Badu and others during her teenage years.\n\nSolange held a moment of silence later on, and the show also honored some of the minorities who died at the hands of police officers, including Trayvon Martin, Philando Castile, Eric Garner and others.\n\nOther winners included gospel rapper Lecrae and Migos, who took home best group. The hip-hop trio also won over the audience with its performances of the hits “Bad and Boujee,” ”T-Shirt” and “Congratulations,” with Post Malone. Chance the Rapper, and his mom, danced during the long set; as did Queen Latifah, Cardi B., “Stranger Things” actor Caleb McLaughlin and “black-ish” actress Yara Shahidi, who won the YoungStars award.\n\nThough most of the performances were upbeat, others charmed with slower songs: Tamar Braxton and Maxwell gave vocally impressive performances, and Mary J. Blige sang songs from “Strength of a Woman,” her recent album that includes emotional tunes about her divorce.\n\n“Mary J. got that break up body. Whoa,” screamed Jamie Foxx, who presented an award after Blige’s performance.\n\nLeslie Jones of “Saturday Night Live” hosted the four-hour show. El DeBarge and Kamasi Washignton performed “Careless Whisper” in honor George Michael, who died last year on Christmas Day, while Janelle Monae collaborator Roman GianArthur excitedly sang “Johnny B. Goode” in tribute to Chuck Berry, who died in March.\n\nNew York rapper Prodigy, who died last week, was remembered in words by his Mobb Deep partner Havoc and Lil Kim, who appeared on the remix of the memorable Mobb Deep hit, “Quiet Storm.”\n\nFormer BET executive Stephen Hill, who the network said was stepping down in March, was praised throughout the night with kind words from Mars and Bobby Brown.\n\n______\n\nOnline:\n\nhttp://www.bet.com/shows/bet-awards/	2017-06-26 23:36:51.384968+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	6	1125	['The Washington Times Http', 'Mesfin Fekadu']

ANALYSIS/OPINION:\n\nWhen it comes to immigration policy, the contrast between the Obama and Trump administrations could not possibly be any starker. Whereas President Obama institutionalized lawlessness, President Trump is determined to reverse course and enforce our nation’s immigration laws - a welcome change.\n\nEarlier this month, in a memorandum issued by Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, the Trump administration formally ended President Barack Obama’s unpopular (and also illegal) Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA).\n\nDAPA came into existence when, back in 2014, Obama issued an executive order instructing government officials to defer the enforcement of our nation’s deportation law for an entire category of people - the parents of children born in the United States, and also of children who were brought to the country illegally. For clarification, “deferred enforcement of the law” is Washington-speak for ignoring the law.\n\nDAPA, however, never went into effect because 26 states sued, and the U.S. Supreme Court last year upheld a temporary injunction, which effectively pressed the pause button on DAPA.\n\nEnding an illegal amnesty directive of the Obama era that flouted the law is an undoubtedly important step for the Trump administration - even if the program that was rescinded never actually went into effect. As a nation that cherishes the rule of law, we simply cannot allow to stand presidential edicts that make a mockery of our written laws. And Trump should be applauded, not only for recognizing that truth, but also for taking the significant step to reverse this instance of defiant disregard for the law.\n\nThat’s the good news.\n\nBut noticeably absent from the DHS memo last week was the rescission of another illegal Obama program - DACA, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. Like DAPA, DACA is an Obama executive order that grants another form of large-scale amnesty - this one for those who were brought here illegally in childhood. But unlike DAPA, DACA is still in effect today. And the time to reverse this policy is long overdue.\n\nBoth the DACA and DAPA amnesty initiatives reflect Obama’s willful disregard for our system of separation of powers. When Congress failed to move forward with President Obama’s amnesty agenda, Obama took the extraordinary measure of saying his administration would not enforce the deportation laws on the books. Never mind that the U.S. Constitution charges the executive branch with the chief responsibility of enforcing the laws.\n\nPresident Obama’s amnesty programs were never popular with American citizens. Both programs were a reminder that the Obama administration felt perfectly comfortable setting aside the law when it suited the president’s purposes.\n\nAs a candidate last year, Donald Trump promised to do away with DAPA and DACA, on the grounds that they are both examples of lawless amnesty. So, it’s no wonder that many conservatives - especially those who voted for President Trump because he was such an unabashed critic of amnesty - were scratching their heads in bewilderment that the Trump administration rescinded the not-yet-in-effect DAPA program, without also simultaneously rescinding DACA, which remains in effect and continues to undermine our immigration laws.\n\nOn Friday, the Department of Homeland Security rushed to issue a statement to clarify why DACA was not ended with the same memo about DAPA. An excerpt from the statement reads: “DAPA and DACA are two different programs … The fact that DACA was not rescinded by the same memo should not be interpreted as bearing any relevance on the long-term future of that program … The future of the DACA program continues to be under review with the Administration.”\n\nAs the Trump administration reviews DACA, it is worthwhile for administration officials to review several foundational truths of the rule of law. First, laws must mean what they say, and they must say what they mean. Second, selectively enforcing laws to suit the governing elite’s purposes is a hallmark feature of banana republics - and that practice has no place in the U.S. legal system. Third, duly enacted laws must be duly enforced; the non-enforcement of any law only invites more people to break the law.\n\nAmericans have a wide range of opinions on immigration policy. But one area where Americans are overwhelmingly united is on the issue of enforcing our laws on the books.\n\nAs the Trump administration continues its review of DACA, Americans should consider that review process an open invitation from the administration to call, tweet, email, and use every modern form of communication to let the White House know how vitally important it is to end DACA immediately.\n\nPresident Trump has the unique opportunity here to establish his legacy as a rule-of-law president who reversed course on the systematic lawlessness that currently characterizes much of our immigration policy. He also has the rare opportunity to translate a major campaign promise into a decisive policy victory. Let’s hope the administration’s review of DACA points the president in the right direction on what must be done.	2017-06-26 23:37:18.027594+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	6	1133	['The Washington Times Http', 'Jenny Beth Martin']

By Stephen Nellis\n\nJune 26 (Reuters) - Apple CEO Tim Cook on Sunday highlighted the economic impact the company is having on India in a meeting with its prime minister as the iPhone maker seeks deeper access to the world's third-largest smartphone market behind the United States and China.\n\nCook met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at a business summit in Washington at a time when Apple Inc is targeting the nascent Indian market as a revenue source after its sales in China slipped.\n\nApple has asked Indian government officials for a range of tax and policy changes to help build out its iPhone assembly work in the country. It is seeking permission to open its own retail stores in India where it currently sells iPhones through resellers.\n\nIn his meeting with Modi, Cook disclosed that Apple expected its Indian operations to be run completely from renewable energy within the next six months, according to a person familiar with the discussion.\n\nCook reiterated that Apple had generated 740,000 jobs in India through its so-called "app economy" and Indian developers had created nearly 100,000 apps for the App Store, the person said.\n\nModi talked with Cook and other U.S. corporate leaders ahead of a meeting with President Donald Trump on Monday. Apple, working with contract manufacturer Winstron, began assembling the iPhone SE in Bengaluru last month. Indian authorities have offered Apple tax concessions for the work with the requirement that more local components be used over time. The company is looking to India after sales in the greater China region, once a major factor in Apple's rise, fell 14 percent year over year to $10.7 billion in the most recent quarter.\n\nApple has not disclosed how much revenue it generates in India but said that sales grew by "strong double digits" there in the most recent quarter.\n\n"We have a ton of energy going into the country on a number of fronts," Cook told analysts about Apple's efforts in India during the company's most recent earnings call. "We believe, particularly now that the 4G infrastructure is going in the country and it's continuing to be expanded, there is a huge opportunity for Apple there."

CAIRO (AP) - With soccer sponsorships, record-setting skyscrapers and wintertime golfing, the United Arab Emirates has projected an image of comfort and opportunity in a volatile region. But the quiet expansion of its military footprint is drawing a different kind of attention to the Gulf federation as it wades into some of the region’s messiest conflicts.\n\nThe Emirates flatly denied allegations revealed in an Associated Press investigation last week that its forces were running secret prisons inside Yemen where detainees were tortured, calling it “completely untrue.”\n\nThe UAE is a key member of a Saudi-led military coalition that is mired in a two-year stalemate against the Shiite Houthi rebels who control Yemen’s capital and much of the country’s north. It is also part of the U.S.-led coalition battling the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria, and backs a powerful general in eastern Libya who rejects a U.N.-backed government. Last week the UAE joined other Gulf nations in a stunning move to boycott and partially blockade Qatar\n\nThe growing list of foreign commitments is drawing increased scrutiny to the federation of Gulf monarchies, which hosts some 5,000 American military personnel, as well as fighter jets and drones.\n\nTHE BUILDUP\n\nThe former British protectorate merged the smaller forces of its seven sheikhdoms into a national military force that took part in the 1991 U.S.-led Gulf War expelling Iraqi forces from Kuwait.\n\nSince then it has been gradually building up experience and capabilities, sending troops to Kosovo as part of the NATO-led peacekeeping mission there starting in 1999, and special forces to Afghanistan to support the U.S.-led war against the Taliban.\n\nToday, the UAE hosts Western forces at its military bases, including American and French troops. Jebel Ali port in Dubai serves as the biggest port of call for the American Navy outside of the United States.\n\n___\n\nCLOSE WESTERN ALLY\n\nThe UAE was one of the most prominent Arab members to join the U.S.-led coalition striking IS targets in Syria. Its contribution gained particular attention for the role played by a female fighter pilot early in the campaign.\n\nAnd while its military only numbers in the tens of thousands, it spends a whopping 6 percent of GDP on defense, allowing it to acquire advanced weapons systems from France, Britain and the U.S. The Pentagon said a new, 15-year defense cooperation agreement signed in May would “enable closer and more agile collaboration against a range of threats.”\n\n“They’re trying to curry favor with the U.S. by taking on more and more roles in the region, to carve out their niche and emerge at the coveted position of being Washington’s Number One Arab Ally,” said Christopher Davidson of Britain’s Durham University.\n\n“They’ve had to make deals with some unsavory characters to protect their flanks in places like Yemen, but in general they’ve proven more deft at keeping a cleaner image than, for example, the Saudis,” he added.\n\n___\n\nYEMEN QUAGMIRE\n\nThe quagmire in Yemen, and the recent allegations regarding detainees held by the UAE and its allies, could undermine that image, especially as the bloody conflict shows no sign of being resolved.\n\nThe UAE has suffered the most wartime casualties in its history in Yemen. The deadliest day came in September 2015, when a missile strike on a base killed over 50 Emirati troops, as well as at least 10 soldiers from Saudi Arabia and five from Bahrain.\n\nEmirati forces were involved in a Jan. 29 Yemen raid ordered by U.S. President Donald Trump that killed a U.S. Navy SEAL and 30 others, including women, children and an estimated 14 militants.\n\nLast week, the AP documented at least 18 clandestine lockups across southern Yemen run by the United Arab Emirates or by Yemeni forces created and trained by the Gulf nation. Hundreds of men swept up in the hunt for al-Qaida militants have disappeared into the prisons, where abuse is routine and torture extreme - including the “grill,” in which the victim is tied to a spit like a roast and spun in a circle of fire.\n\nSeveral U.S. senators have called for investigations into reports that U.S. military interrogators worked with those forces. Defense officials told the AP that the department had looked into reports of torture and concluded that its personnel were not involved or aware of any abuse.\n\n___\n\nAFRICA\n\nThe UAE has been building up a long-term military presence in Eritrea at its port in Assab, according to Stratfor, a U.S.-based private intelligence firm. Satellite images show new construction at a once-abandoned airfield the firm links to the Emiratis, as well as development at the port and the deployment of tanks and aircraft.\n\nSouth of Eritrea, in Somalia’s breakaway northern territory of Somaliland, authorities agreed in February to allow the UAE open a naval base in the port town of Berbera. Previously, the UAE international ports operator DP World struck a deal to manage Somaliland’s largest port nearby.\n\nFurther afield, the UAE also has been suspected of conducting airstrikes in Libya and operating at a small air base in the North African country’s east, near the Egyptian border. Along with Egypt, it supports Field Marshal Khalifa Hifter, whose forces are battling Islamic militants as well as factions allied with a U.N.-backed government in Tripoli.\n\nSomalia remains a particular focus for the UAE. The Emiratis sent forces to the Horn of Africa country to take part in a U.N. peacekeeping mission in the 1990s, while their elite counterterrorism unit in 2011 rescued a UAE-flagged ship from Somali pirates.

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani publicly blasted efforts by a Saudi-led coalition to economically and politically segregate Qatar from the larger Arab world, calling the ongoing blockade against the small, oil-rich country “unacceptable.”\n\nIn his first public speech condemning the actions by the Gulf Cooperation Council or GCC members against Qatar, Mr. Rouhani vowed that Tehran would remain Doha’s stalwart ally whose “airspace, land and sea of our country will always be open to Qatar as a brotherly and neighboring country.”\n\nIt was Qatar’s extensive ties to Iran, whose hardliners inside the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps openly finance terror groups such as Hezbollah and Hamas, as well as the Muslim Brotherhood that prompted the GCC coalition to implement an air and sea blockade and political embargo against Doha in June.\n\nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson has said the Saudi-led blockade against Qatar has sparked a humanitarian crisis inside the country, since critical deliveries of food and medicine have been held up as a result of the GCC action.\n\nTehran has sent six aircraft into Qatar as part of an ongoing food airlift program for the besieged country since the blockade went into place As of mid-June, over 90 tons of food has been flown into the country by Iranian aircraft, with another 350 tons waiting to be shipped by Iranian vessels from the port of Dayyer, local reports say.\n\nMr. Rouhani’s comments came days after Doha rejected Saudi terms to end the blockade and subsequent sequestration of Qatar from the larger Middle East. Kuwait moderated the negotiations to draft terms for normalization of relations between Doha and the GCC, which Secretary of State Rex Tillerson expressed support for prior to their rejection by Doha. One of the terms in the deal called for Qatar to shutter the state-subsidized news outlet Al Jazeera.\n\nOn Thursday, two former Al Jazzera employees accused the news organization for openly collaborating with the Muslim Brotherhood. Mohamed Fahmy and Mohamed Fawzi were working for Al Jazeera English in Cairo when they were arrested in 2013 on charges of terrorism directly linked to their work at the network.\n\nBoth men claimed they had no knowledge of their work in Egypt being tied network’s ties to the jihadi organization. “My colleagues and I, including cameraman Mohamed Fawzi, did not conspire with the Muslim Brotherhood group designated as terrorists. Al Jazeera did and on behalf of the Qatari government who controls the general direction of the coverage,” Mr. Fahmy said during a briefing in Washington last Thursday.\n\nMr. Fawzi, an Egyptian citizen, was released after a few days in prison and fled the country for Qatar before coming to the U.S. He was tried in abstentia, sentenced to 10 years in prison and designated an international terrorist.\n\nMr. Fahmy, an Egyptian-Canadian, spent over 400 days in Egypt’s “Scorpion prison,” including a month in solitary confinement. He was issued a pardon by Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi and released from prison in September 2015.\n\n*Laura Kelly contributed to this report	2017-06-26 23:37:08.696757+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	6	1130	['The Washington Times Http', 'Carlo Muñoz']

By Sam Forgione\n\nNEW YORK, June 26 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar hit a one-month high against the yen and rebounded against the euro on Monday after the European Central Bank chief defended the ECB's easy monetary policy, and as investors awaited Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's speech on Tuesday.\n\nECB President Mario Draghi, speaking to university students in Lisbon, said super low rates create jobs, foster growth and benefit borrowers, ultimately easing inequality. The euro fell earlier this month after the ECB said policymakers had not discussed scaling back its massive bond-buying program.\n\nThe euro, which hit a more than one-week high against the U.S. dollar of $1.1219 earlier in the session after weaker-than-expected U.S. May durable goods orders data fueled doubts about the U.S. economy and the Federal Reserve's aggressive rate increase outlook, eased after Draghi's remarks.\n\n"Draghi pouring water on expectations of reducing monetary stimulus, that saw the euro then start to weaken," said Douglas Borthwick, managing director at Chapdelaine Foreign Exchange in New York.\n\nFed Chair Yellen is set to deliver a speech in Europe on Tuesday. Analysts said traders were expecting Yellen to maintain a positive outlook on the U.S. economy despite a recent batch of weak U.S. economic data, thereby supporting the Fed's forecast of raising interest rates once more this year and three times next year.\n\nThose expectations helped the dollar gain against a basket of major currencies. The dollar hit a one-month high against the yen of 111.93 yen. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was last up 0.2 percent at 97.440.\n\nThe risk that Yellen could tweak her outlook in a more dovish direction kept traders on tenterhooks and limited the dollar's gains.\n\nWorries have grown that an acceleration in economic growth in the second quarter may not be as robust as expected. Recent data on retail sales, manufacturing production and inflation have given pause and housing data has been mixed.\n\n"We´ll know more from Yellen tomorrow," said Thierry Albert Wizman, global interest rates and currencies strategist at Macquarie Group Ltd in New York. "Traders are still split on what the Fed is going to do."\n\nThe euro was last down 0.1 percent against the dollar at $1.1179. The dollar fell against emerging market currencies, however, partly on a reach for higher-yielding alternatives to the greenback amid low volatility. The dollar was last down 1.3 percent against the Brazilian real at 3.2998 reais.

(AP) - At 31 and entering his 14th NBA season, eight-time All-Star Dwight Howard says his best basketball is ahead of him.\n“I’m just looking forward to this opportunity because I have a lot left in the tank.”This will be Howard’s third team in three seasons.\nHoward said he has no hard feelings, adding that “sometimes things just don’t work out.”But he’s confident Charlotte is the right fit.\n“I think I’m a lot healthier than I have been in the past five years and I think this is going to be my best time,” Howard said.\n“Over the years a lot of things have been said and I’ve not said anything back,” Howard said.	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) - At 31 and entering his 14th NBA season, eight-time All-Star Dwight Howard says his best basketball is ahead of him.\n\nWearing a teal suit with black trim, a smiling Howard insisted Monday he can return to being a dominant center with the Charlotte Hornets, where he will be reunited with coach Steve Clifford and play for one of his childhood heroes, team owner Michael Jordan.\n\n“A lot of people have written me off, which is great because it’s going to make me work even harder,” Howard said during his introductory news conference. “I’m just looking forward to this opportunity because I have a lot left in the tank.”\n\nThis will be Howard’s third team in three seasons.\n\nThe Atlanta Hawks, his hometown team, traded him to Charlotte one year into a three-year, $74 million contract. Howard said he has no hard feelings, adding that “sometimes things just don’t work out.”\n\nBut he’s confident Charlotte is the right fit.\n\n“I think I’m a lot healthier than I have been in the past five years and I think this is going to be my best time,” Howard said. “I’m a lot wiser now, stronger mentally and physically, and I’m in the right place with a great coach, a great GM and the GOAT (greatest of all time). So I think this is the perfect opportunity.”\n\nMuch of Howard’s optimism stems from being reunited with Clifford.\n\nThey worked together for seven seasons in Orlando and Los Angeles, and the 6-foot-11 three-time Defensive Player of the Year loves Clifford’s defense-first mentality. He’s also confident Clifford will put him in the right situations to succeed on offense.\n\n“He understands me,” Howard said. “… He was always there for me and not once did he turn his back on me or talk bad about me. He was very positive and he was somebody that I have always trusted in.”\n\nThe feeling is mutual.\n\nClifford said he’s never coached a player smarter than Howard when it comes to understanding defensive coverages. While Howard has incredible athletic ability, Clifford said, he’s never been given the credit he deserves for playing a “thinking man’s game.”\n\n“Smart always wins in the NBA,” Clifford said.\n\nHoward is expected to start in Charlotte alongside All-Star point guard Kemba Walker, guard Nic Batum and forwards Michael Kidd-Gilchrist and Marvin Williams. Cody Zeller, last year’s starting center, is expected to come off the bench for the Hornets but still see significant minutes.\n\nHoward said he’s learned a lot over the past 13 seasons.\n\n“Over the years a lot of things have been said and I’ve not said anything back,” Howard said. “Somehow things that weren’t true kept getting stirred up, and that gave a lot of people wrong opinions about who I was as a person. I should be the one speaking up for myself instead of allowing other people to do that.”\n\nIn Charlotte, Howard becomes the second big-name athlete to be known as “Superman,” joining former NFL MVP quarterback Cam Newton of the Carolina Panthers.\n\nBoth are from the Atlanta area and have met a couple of times but aren’t close friends. Howard said he’s eager to connect with Newton and get to know him better.\n\n“We have the same attitude; we love to win, but we want to have fun,” Howard said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/tag/NBAbasketball	2017-06-26 23:37:33.39641+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	6	1137	['The Washington Times Http', 'Steve Reed']

Schumer, New York Democrat.\nRepublicans and President Trump’s health secretary have tried to downplay the CBO’s ability to estimate the effects of their bill.\nYet to placate fiscal hawks, the plan would allow Medicaid spending to rise at a slower rate than in the House version, starting in 2025.	Senate Republicans released a revised version of their health care plan Monday, replacing Obamacare’s “individual mandate” with a provision designed to prevent Americans from waiting until they get sick to sign up for insurance coverage.\n\nThe updated draft would require consumers who had a break in coverage for 63 days or more in the prior year to wait six months before their insurance takes effect. It’s a twist on the House bill, which would have allowed insurers to tack on a surcharge after long lapses in coverage.\n\nRepublicans say the provision, which begins in 2019, is needed to make sure people don’t “game the system” by waiting to enroll in a plan right before they submit costly medical claims, rather than paying premiums over time.\n\nInsurers pushed for the provision because Republicans want to scrap penalties tied to President Obama’s unpopular mandate, which forces people to get coverage or pay a tax.\n\nWhile insurers reviewed the proposal, Democrats faulted it outright, saying it would penalize people who lose their jobs, fall on hard times or otherwise lose coverage through no fault of their own.\n\n“The Senate Republicans’ latest version of Trumpcare would pour salt in that wound, locking American families out of health insurance for even longer thanks to this six-month ban provision,” said Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, is using fast-track budget rules to carve Democrats out of the repeal process, so restive holdouts in his own conference are his main worry ahead of a planned vote this week\n\nHe cannot afford to lose more than two members of his 52-seat majority and still pass a plan.\n\nYet five Senate Republicans have said they won’t vote for the bill in its current form — four conservatives who say the legislation doesn’t fix Obamacare’s flaws and drive down premiums, and Sen. Dean Heller, Nevada Republican, who is vulnerable in next year’s election cycle and says the bill is too tough on Medicaid coverage for the poor.\n\nSen. Ron Johnson, Wisconsin Republican, was unusually blunt during a radio interview with Hugh Hewitt, saying party leaders were trying to jam the legislation through the chamber before senators could vet it or make useful changes.\n\nSenate Majority Whip John Cornyn, Texas Republican, made it clear on Monday that he isn’t interested in letting the floor fight slip beyond this week.\n\n“I am closing the door. We need to do it this week before double-digit premium increases are announced for next year,” he said on Twitter, responding to news reports that he left the door open to a delay through Aug. 1.\n\nAlso Monday, the Congressional Budget Office is expected to release its budget analysis, or “score,” of how the draft legislation will impact federal spending and coverage.\n\nThe bill’s drafters expect the score to reflect the latest changes, according to an aide.\n\nRepublicans and President Trump’s health secretary have tried to downplay the CBO’s ability to estimate the effects of their bill. They say the figures are dependent on future behavior, such as how many people choose to forgo insurance because they would no longer be penalized.\n\n“The CBO does a great job, by and large, on how much something costs — budget, that’s what they do well,” Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price said Sunday. “They do a relatively poor job on what the coverage consequences of a health plan are.”\n\nStill, the CBO’s findings should guide Republican senators who are trying to decide whether they can back the plan ahead of a planned vote this week.\n\n“I want to wait to see the CBO analysis. But I have very serious concerns about the bill,” Sen. Susan M. Collins, Maine Republican and notable holdout, said Sunday on ABC News.\n\nAs written, the draft bill repeals most of Obamacare’s taxes and penalties tied to its individual mandate, replaces its generous subsidies with refundable, age-based tax credits and reins in and caps spending on the Medicaid program for the poor. It also strips Planned Parenthood of federal funding as punishment for its abortion practice\n\nUnlike the House bill, the Senate plan scales down funding for states that embraced Mr. Obama’s vast expansion of Medicaid for the poor through 2024, rather than freezing it in 2020.\n\nIt also provided more generous tax credits to poorer and older Americans who could struggle to afford coverage under the House plan.\n\nYet to placate fiscal hawks, the plan would allow Medicaid spending to rise at a slower rate than in the House version, starting in 2025.\n\nThe American Medical Association blasted the plan Monday for cutting Medicaid spending, allowing insurers to offer skimpier coverage and replacing Obamacare’s subsidies with less generous tax credits, citing the doctor’s oath to “first, do no harm.”\n\n“The draft legislation violates that standard on many levels,” AMA CEO James L. Madara said.	2017-06-26 23:37:34.279163+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	6	1138	['The Washington Times Http', 'Tom Howell Jr.']

BOSTON (AP) - The health care bill proposed by U.S. Senate Republican leaders would result in 264,000 Massachusetts residents losing their insurance and have a cumulative financial impact on the state of more than $8.2 billion by 2025, Republican Gov. Charlie Baker warned Monday.\n\nBaker unveiled his administration’s latest analysis in a letter addressed to Sen. Elizabeth Warren and sent to each member of the state’s all-Democratic congressional delegation.\n\n“Overall, our analysis indicates that the (Senate bill) would increasingly strain the state’s fiscal resources, result in greater numbers of individuals without insurance and destabilize the commercial insurance market,” the governor wrote.\n\nUnder the GOP proposal, Baker writes that the state would lose $907 million in 2020, with the annual fiscal impact climbing to $1.7 billion in 2024.\n\nHe cited several reasons for the impact, including the loss in 2020 of $600 million in safety net funding that was part of a Medicaid waiver the Baker administration negotiated with former President Barack Obama’s administration; the elimination starting in 2023 of federal matching funds to cover those in Massachusetts who received coverage under the expansion of Medicaid; a cap on overall federal matching funds; and a provision in the bill that he wrote would, “with no justification,” shift billions of dollars in matching funds from higher wage states like Massachusetts to lower wage states.\n\nThe Senate bill, which would repeal and replace key portions of the Affordable Care Act, would have less of a financial impact on Massachusetts in the first few years than an earlier version of the bill passed by the U.S. House, Baker noted, but the consequences of the Senate bill would become more severe after 2020.\n\nThe state’s congressional delegation needs little convincing on the issue from the governor. Both Warren and Democratic Sen. Edward Markey have been outspoken in their opposition to the GOP bill, and all nine House members voted against the bill that passed in that chamber.\n\nSeparately on Monday, Baker and Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, sent a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on behalf of the National Governors Association asking that states be given more time to review the bill to determine how it might affect their states before a vote is taken in the Senate.	2017-06-26 23:37:49.509395+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	6	1140	['The Washington Times Http']

NEW YORK (AP) — “Pharma Bro” just won’t keep his mouth shut.\n\nEven with his federal securities fraud trial set to begin Monday, Martin Shkreli has blatantly defied his attorneys’ advice to lay low. The former pharmaceutical CEO, who became a pariah after raising the cost of a life-saving drug 5,000 percent, has been preening for cameras and trolling on social media, potentially complicating his defense.\n\n“I’m excited,” Shkreli said of the trial in a brief phone call last week to The Associated Press. “I can’t wait.”\n\nSince his high-profile arrest in late 2015 when he was led into court in a gray hoodie, Shkreli has been free on bail and free to speak his mind. He went on Twitter to label members of Congress “imbeciles” for demanding to know why his company, Turing Pharmaceuticals, raised the price of Daraprim, a drug used to treat toxoplasmosis and HIV, from $13.50 to $750 per pill.\n\nHe took to YouTube for a series of lessons on chemistry and stock market analysis. His Twitter posts mocking a freelance journalist turned so creepy — one showed a fake photo of him canoodling with her — that his account was shut down. And on Facebook, he mused about the possibility of being “unjustly imprisoned.”\n\nThe 34-year-old Shkreli “travels to the beat of a very unique drummer,” exasperated-sounding defense attorney Benjamin Brafman said at a pretrial hearing this month.\n\nLegal experts say there are obvious reasons lawyers want clients facing serious criminal charges to keep quiet.\n\n“It’s twofold: You don’t want to antagonize the judge and you don’t want to get the attention of the jury in a way that hurts your case,” said veteran New York City defense attorney Gerald Lefcourt.\n\nColumbia law professor John Coffee compared the situation to President Donald Trump’s unruly tweeting habits. “A lawyer can caution him,” he said. “But just like Trump, he doesn’t have to listen.”\n\nThough Shkreli’s notoriety came from Daraprim, the federal securities fraud case is unrelated. Prosecutors say that after Shkreli lost millions of dollars through bad trades through his side business hedge fund, he looted a second pharmaceutical company for $11 million to pay them back. The defense has argued that he had good intentions.\n\n“Everybody got paid back in this case,” his lawyer said. “Whatever else he did wrong, he ultimately made them whole.”\n\nThe defense has floated the possibility that it would put Shkreli on the witness stand to try to highlight how he grew up in a working-class Albanian family in Brooklyn, taught himself chemistry, interned at a financial firm founded by CNBC’s Jim Cramer and struck out on his own to become a rising star in biotechnology startups. He wanted to develop new life-saving drugs after seeing “several classmates and other children he knew struck down by debilitating disease,” court papers say.\n\nProsecutors call it a ploy to portray the boyish-looking Shkreli as “a Horatio Alger-like figure who, through hard work and intelligence, is in a position to do great things if only the jury would ignore the evidence and base its verdict on sympathy.” The real Shkreli was a con man often undone by his own mouth, they say.\n\nThe government has cited claims by one of Shkreli’s former employees that Shkreli harassed his family in a dispute over shares of stock.\n\n“I hope to see you and your four children homeless and will do whatever I can to assure this,” Shkreli wrote the employee’s wife, according to court filings.\n\nProsecutors also used his boasts about some of his purchases of eccentric collectibles to undermine efforts to reduce his bail from $5 million to $2 million. If he needed to raise cash to pay legal fees and back taxes, they argued, why not sell the one-of-a-kind Wu-Tang Clan album that he brought for $2 million or his Nazi-era Engima code-breaking machine?\n\nAlso cited were his offers to pay a $100,000 bounty for finding the killer of a Democratic National Committee staffer and $40,000 in tuition for a Princeton student who solved a math problem he posed during a guest lecture at the school earlier this year.\n\nShkreli “is not the demon he’s been made out to be,” the student, Yuan Wang, told the AP.\n\nStill, he added, “I haven’t received the money yet.”	2017-06-26 23:37:50.638915+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	6	1141	['The Washington Times Http', 'Tom Hays']

The Supreme Court revived President Trump’s extreme vetting travel ban Monday, ruling that much of it can go into effect — and along the way delivering an implicit rebuke to the army of lower-court judges who’d blasted the president as anti-Muslim.\n\nThe unanimous decision said Mr. Trump can impose a 90-day pause on most admissions from six terrorist-connected countries, and a 120-day halt in all refugees admissions. The exceptions are citizens of those countries who already have ties to the U.S., such as relatives living here, or participation in a student program.\n\n“An American individual or entity that has a bona fide relationship with a particular person seeking to enter the country as a refugee can legitimately claim concrete hard- ship if that person is excluded,” the justices said in the unsigned opinion. “But when it comes to refugees who lack any such connection to the United States, for the reasons we have set out, the balance tips in favor of the Government’s compelling need to provide for the Nation’s security.”\n\nPresident Trump declared the ruling “a clear victory for our national security,” saying the decision allows his plans “to become largely effective.”\n\n“My number one responsibility as Commander in Chief is to keep the American people safe,” he said in a statement. “Today’s ruling allows me to use an important tool for protecting our Nation’s homeland. I am also particularly gratified that the Supreme Court’s decision was 9-0.”\n\nBut immigrant-rights groups vowed to push for as broad an exception as possible for those who already have connections to the U.S. They said anyone who’s been approved for refugee resettlement already has a tie to the country, as does nearly every other person hoping to travel to the U.S. from the six countries Mr. Trump singled out.\n\nSEE ALSO: Supreme Court declines to hear challenge to concealed carry restrictions\n\n“A majority of people won’t be impacted by this,” predicted Marielena Hincapie, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center.\n\nThe Homeland Security Department said it will soon provide more details about his it will carry out the new ruling.\n\n“The Department will provide additional details on implementation after consultation with the Departments of Justice and State,” Homeland Security said. “The implementation of the Executive Order will be done professionally, with clear and sufficient public notice, particularly to potentially affected travelers, and in coordination with partners in the travel industry.”\n\nThree members of the court — Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Neil M. Gorsuch — signed an opinion saying they’d have gone further and revived Mr. Trump’s extreme vetting plan in total, without the exceptions for those with close connections.\n\n“I fear that the Court’s remedy will prove unworkable,” Justice Thomas said. “Today’s compromise will burden executive officials with the task of deciding —on peril of contempt — whether individuals from the six affected nations who wish to enter the United States have a sufficient connection to a person or entity in this country.”\n\nImmigrant-rights groups were already arguing that nearly every potential refugee has a tie to the U.S. by dint of the fact that a resettlement agency in the U.S. is working on their case.\n\nSen. Charles E. Grassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, countered that the only exceptions are when someone “has a close familial relationship or has a formal, documented purpose for entering the United States, such as a job or acceptance at a college or university.”\n\nThose fights aside, the ruling is the first major legal victory for Mr. Trump, who had been blasted by lower courts — chiefly Democratic-appointed judges — for showing “animus” to Muslims and for failing to justify his national security concerns. The justices, though, said the president deserves deference when acting on national security concerns in immigration matters when dealing with people who don’t already have a tie to the U.S.\n\n“The Supreme Court did what the lower court judges would not — treat President Trump like any other president with the ‘presumption of regularity,’” Josh Blackman, associate professor at South Texas College of Law, wrote on his blog. “The Justices did not delve into the president’s twitter account, nor did they parse his campaign statements.”\n\nThe court scheduled the broader case as part of its next session that begins in October.\n\nThe justices, though, signaled they expect Mr. Trump to use the reprieve to quickly figure out new policies and to put them in place: “Given the Government’s representations in this litigation concerning the resources required to complete the 20-day review, we fully expect that the relief we grant today will permit the Executive to conclude its internal work and provide adequate notice to foreign governments” within the timeframe laid out by Mr. Trump.\n\nThat could make the case moot by the time the October session of the court arrives.\n\nThe six countries targeted for the travel ban are Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.\n\nTwo federal appeals courts had upheld injunctions of varying degrees of severity.\n\nOne court in Virginia ruled that Mr. Trump’s past words about Muslims showed an “animus” toward Muslims that invalidated the six-country travel ban, though they let the refugee restrictions remain in place. A court in California, though, struck down even the refugee restrictions, arguing the president broke the law because he never drew a specific connection between his actions and the national security concerns he said spurred him.\n\nMr. Trump’s opponents said Monday’s ruling doesn’t settle matters for them.\n\n“Donald Trump’s Muslim ban is an unconstitutional and un-American assault on our country’s foundation of religious freedom,” said Tom Perez, chairman of the Democratic National Committee. “As a nation, our diversity is our greatest strength, and we cannot allow such prejudice to shut the doors of progress.”	2017-06-26 23:40:18.570524+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	6	1171	['The Washington Times Http', 'Stephen Dinan']

City of New London.\nNow, thanks to the Supreme Court, states are now free to change the rules and deprive someone of the value of property.\nThe Supreme Court is accelerating the movement of Americans from being property owners to being serfs.\nWith the latest ruling from the Supreme Court, property owners in this nation are only one step above being serfs.\nAmerica is on the road to serfdom and that road is paved with bad Supreme Court decisions.	ANALYSIS/OPINION:\n\nLiberty is slowly dying in this nation. The battles where liberty dies are mostly not the headline grabbing stories, but instead small cuts that help reduce this nation to despotism.\n\nOne of the cornerstones of liberty in America is property rights. In other nations, past and present, the sovereign could take a citizen’s property and the citizen was simply out of luck. Our founding fathers so feared the power of the government to take private property that they included what is known as the “takings clause” in the Fifth Amendment.\n\nThe Fifth Amendment is one of the most expansive amendments to the United States Constitution and it includes the takings clause; which states, “nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.”\n\nRecently, the committee of nine unelected lawyers known as the Supreme Court gutted the Fifth Amendment. The case was called Murr v. Wisconsin.\n\nIn the Murr case, a family in Wisconsin owned two lots. On one, they built a nice cabin and the other they left undeveloped. The family at some point planned to sell the second lot at a profit. While the Murr family waited and their lot appreciated to $400,000 estimated value, the State of Wisconsin changed the rules.\n\nThe Murr family wanted to sell the one lot and keep their cabin. But under the new rules, the only allowable buyer for the lot was the State of Wisconsin. And the State of Wisconsin told them even more good news. If they wanted to sell, they would have to sell both of their lots, and the State of Wisconsin, the only permitted buyer, would only pay them $40,000.\n\nThe Murr family was outraged and sued under the takings clause. The Murrs (correctly) contended that by changing the rules after the family had bought the land and reducing the value, the government had taken their property.\n\nIn an utterly horrible decision, the United States Supreme Court ruled 5-3 that what Wisconsin did was not a taking under the U.S. Constitution.\n\n\n\nIn 2005, the Supreme Court decided the case of Kelso v. City of New London. In that case, the City of New London sought to use eminent domain to take private property for not a government purpose but for to be sold to another private company.\n\nThe idea that a private company could use the government to force an unwilling seller to give up their property is repugnant to liberty. Now, thanks to the Supreme Court, states are now free to change the rules and deprive someone of the value of property.\n\nThe Supreme Court is accelerating the movement of Americans from being property owners to being serfs. Under serfdom, serfs were bound to the land and were responsible for the land, even though they never received any benefit from the land.\n\nSurveys show that fewer millennials are interested in property ownership. Why should they be? With the latest ruling from the Supreme Court, property owners in this nation are only one step above being serfs. Why would anyone want to spend their wealth on property the government can take at whim.\n\nAmerica is on the road to serfdom and that road is paved with bad Supreme Court decisions.	2017-06-26 23:40:19.569233+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	6	1172	['The Washington Times Http', 'Judson Phillips']

1518	After rocky road in LA, Russell seeks smooth start with Nets			http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jun/26/after-rocky-road-in-la-russell-seeks-smooth-start-/	\N	NEW YORK (AP) - D'Angelo Russell wasn’t only traded, he was insulted on the way out the door.\nGiven that Johnson is one of the greatest ever to play the position, the sting might have really hurt Russell.\nBut his turbulent time in Los Angeles is over, so the only voices Russell are listening to are in Brooklyn.\nMarks didn’t dwell on the past, believing Russell will find a more stable situation under second-year coach Kenny Atkinson.\nBut the key to the deal will be Russell, who joins Jeremy Lin as the point guards on the Nets’ roster.	NEW YORK (AP) - D'Angelo Russell wasn’t only traded, he was insulted on the way out the door.\n\nAfter the Los Angeles Lakers selected Lonzo Ball with the No. 2 pick in the NBA draft, team President Magic Johnson said Russell played well but stressed that he needed a leader as his point guard. Given that Johnson is one of the greatest ever to play the position, the sting might have really hurt Russell.\n\nBut his turbulent time in Los Angeles is over, so the only voices Russell are listening to are in Brooklyn.\n\n“It’s good to be here. I can’t really control that, what they say,” Russell said Monday. “I’m gone. It’s the past. I’m here now. It’s irrelevant, honestly.”\n\nThe Nets introduced Russell and center Timofey Mozgov in a news conference at their training facility, having acquired the pair in the deal last week that sent center Brook Lopez and a draft pick to Los Angeles.\n\nRussell is just 21 and himself was the No. 2 pick just two years ago, the kind of player who isn’t usually available via trade. But the Lakers needed to make room for Ball, and the Nets are in desperate need of talent after finishing with the worst record in the NBA.\n\n“Looking at what the Lakers were dealing with, we’re always in that talent-acquisition mode here,” general manager Sean Marks said. “We will be for a while, but adding a player - specifically D'Angelo being 21 - we could’ve easily drafted somebody who was a year older than D'Angelo.”\n\nRussell averaged 15.6 points last season, an improvement over his rocky rookie season. Fitting in under coach Byron Scott in Kobe Bryant’s final season was a difficult transition, and Russell made it harder on himself when his video of a private conversation with teammate Nick Young ended up on social media.\n\nEven though Russell played better under Luke Walton, the fallout from the video may have already damaged his ability to become the leader Johnson was seeking. Marks didn’t dwell on the past, believing Russell will find a more stable situation under second-year coach Kenny Atkinson.\n\n“I think everybody’s going to question what happened in the past with the whole Nick Young so forth,” Marks said. “But as I said before, I’m not really concerned about that, because I think if any one of us looked in our little dark secret of closets there would be things that we would be embarrassed about and wish we could take back. So again, I’m going to bet on this group, from Kenny, the coaching staff, they’ve done a terrific, terrific job of developing these guys.”\n\nLopez was the Nets’ career scoring leader, but Atkinson believes the Nets will get strong play from Mozgov, remembering how hard the Russian worked when Atkinson was on Mike D’Antoni’s staff with the Knicks. Mozgov didn’t play late last season as the Lakers went with their youth, but he is a strong rim protector who won an NBA championship with the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nBut the key to the deal will be Russell, who joins Jeremy Lin as the point guards on the Nets’ roster. His transition from Ohio State to Los Angeles was rough. Perhaps going coast to coast will be a smoother start.\n\n“A lot of guys have it easier. A lot may have it harder,” Russell said. “My situation was different. It was what it was. It’s the past. I’m here and looking forward to it.”\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/tag/NBAbasketball	2017-06-26 23:40:26.273395+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	6	1174	['The Washington Times Http', 'Brian Mahoney']

The Supreme Court declined Monday to take up a closely watched gun rights case that challenged restrictions on concealed carry — a decision that earned a stinging rebuke from Justice Clarence Thomas.\n\nIn opting not to hear Peruta v. California, the high court let stand an en banc ruling from the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that upheld a California law requiring a gun owner to show “good cause” in order to obtain a permit to carry a concealed handgun in public. The state law left the authority to decide what constitutes “good cause” up to local authorities, like sheriffs or police chiefs.\n\nGun owner Edward Peruta, of San Diego County, brought the case after he sought to carry concealed firearms for self-defense but was denied a concealed-carry license in 2009 because he was unable to show good cause.\n\nJustice Thomas, who was joined by Justice Neil Gorsuch in his dissent, wrote that the lower court’s ruling erred because it had narrowly considered only whether the regulatory concealed carry scheme established by a local sheriff was valid, not whether residents had a broader right to carry firearms openly in public. California law prohibits open carry.\n\n“The Court’s decision to deny certiorari in this case reflects a distressing trend: the treatment of the Second Amendment as a disfavored right,” Justice Thomas wrote.\n\nHe went on to rebuke his colleagues for failing to seriously consider the effect that letting the decision stand would have on every day Americans.\n\n“For those of us who work in marbled halls, guarded constantly by a vigilant and dedicated police force, the guarantees of the Second Amendment might seem antiquated and superfluous,” Justice Thomas wrote. “But the Framers made a clear choice: They reserved to all Americans the right to bear arms for self-defense. I do not think we should stand by idly while a State denies its citizens that right, particularly when their very lives may depend on it.”\n\nIn addition to the 9th Circuit, federal appeals courts have upheld similar restrictive “good reason” requirements in New Jersey, New York and Maryland. An ongoing case is challenging a similar requirement in the District of Columbia.\n\nEric Tirschwell, litigation director for Everytown for Gun Safety, said the Supreme Court’s decision was a “win for gun safety.”\n\n“The Peruta decision is consistent with four other federal appeals courts all across the country that have found the Second Amendment leaves plenty of room for states and localities to make their own determinations about who can carry a concealed handgun in public,” he said.	2017-06-26 23:40:27.337114+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	6	1175	['The Washington Times Http', 'Andrea Noble']

ANALYSIS/OPINION:\n\nEric Trump called the head of the Democratic National Committee, Tom Perez, a “nut job” on national television.\n\nThis came on the heels of him saying, earlier this month, that the Democratic Party is in midst of “imploding” — and he’s right on both counts.\n\nPerez’s main claim to fame right now is that he’s overseeing the Democratic Party’s summer of resistance against President Donald Trump — a movement that simply calls for mass opposition to the White House at the grassroots level, and seeks interested young anarchists and anarchist wanna-bes to get in the game and get on board. It even offers them training to be the best oppositional team member they can be.\n\nAnd it’s such oppositional calls that have led the Democrats down the path of party violence, becoming now known more for the fires its members start, and the clashes its members have with police and pro-Trumpers than for any more civil minded causes, like — oh, I don’t know — civil rights, for example.\n\nThat’s the dynasty Perez is building.\n\nThat’s the path that’s leading the Democrats to implode.\n\n“The DNC is half defunct,” he said, to Fox “Sunday’s Morning Futures” host Maria Bartiromo. “They’ve got no money in the bank. They have no operation. You look at the head of the DNC — he’s quite frankly a nut job. All they’re doing is obstructing and it’s clearly not working because every race that comes along, every special election that comes along, my father is winning.”\n\nIn a recent interview with Sean Hannity, also of Fox News, Trumpsaid similarly, calling Perez a “total whack job” who was an “obstructionist” without a clear vision and party message.\n\nAnd he went on in that same interview to say the whole party was crumbling from within.\n\n“You see the Democratic Party, they’re imploding,” he said then. “They’re imploding. They became obstructionists because they have no message of their own.”\n\nIt doesn’t get any truer than that.\n\nSeriously — when’s the last time you heard a Democrat announcing an idea, a vision, a legislative goal, an agenda and so forth, that didn’t involve resisting the Republicans, or opposing Trump?\n\nFor Democrats, all they have to offer is a fight against Republicans. And while that may appeal to the base, to the zealot-minded of the left, it’s not a long term strategy to win party seats.\n\nResistance and opposition are bound to fizzle at some point. The Democrats’ problem is they’re not offering anything to fill the void that will come when their fight is subdued.	2017-06-26 23:38:56.405026+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	6	1156	['The Washington Times Http', 'Cheryl K.

(AP) - The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Monday that the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency does not need a court order to subpoena a prescription drug database kept by the state of Oregon, but the ruling did not specify whether those subpoenas would violate constitutional protections.\n\nThe ruling reverses a 2014 judge’s ruling finding that the agency must obtain warrants to access the database, which Oregon uses to help healthcare providers identify abuse. The appeals panel, however, said nothing prevents Oregon from challenging individual warrantless subpoenas in court “in light of the particularly important privacy interest implicated here.”\n\nThe ruling did not resolve the question of whether the DEA’s administrative subpoenas violate constitutional protections against unreasonable search and seizure outlined in the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protecting people against unreasonable searches and seizures.\n\nThe Oregon Prescription Drug Monitoring Program sued the DEA in 2012 over the administrative subpoenas for patient prescription records because under state law police must get court orders to check the same database.

The state argued it could not be compelled to disclose health information about a patient without a federal court order.\n\nOregon lawmakers approved the prescription database in 2009 and it became fully operational two years later.

Baseball hasn’t had a team win back-to-back World Series since the New York Yankees did it three straight times from 1998-2000.\n\nDespite that, Nationals manager Dusty Baker isn’t ready to say there’s a natural letdown for World Series champions the following year.\n\n“I think there’s a short winter,” Baker said. “You’ve got a very short winter. You’ve got a very short winter on your pitching staff because while everybody’s resting in the month of October and in November now, you’re still playing. When you do win, it’s not usually until December that you feel like working out. If you take a month off or two weeks off, you’re looking at December.\n\n“You get the rubber chicken circuit, everybody wants a piece of you, everybody wants to celebrate with you and people all around. Next thing you know, it’s time to go to spring training and you don’t have that much time to regroup physically and mentally.”\n\nStarting Monday, the Nationals will face a team that appears to be in the middle of a World Series hangover — the Chicago Cubs.\n\nThe Cubs are just 38-37 and have floated around .500 all year. At this point last season, Chicago was 49-26, a game above the Nationals’ record this season (45-30).\n\nDefending a World Series crown is incredibly tough. The Yankees made the finale for a fourth straight year in 2001, but lost. The 2009 Philadelphia Phillies are the most recent team to have won the World Series and make it back the next year, only to lose.\n\nThe Nationals-Cubs four-game series, which starts Monday night, should serve as a good measuring stick for both teams — and perhaps a preview of an upcoming postseason showdown.\n\nBaker remembered asking Hall of Famer Larry Doby when he started to prepare for the upcoming baseball season.\n\n“My thought was spring training, and he told me you start getting ready a couple weeks after the season’s over,” Baker said. “There are times during the winter you don’t feel like working out, but you do it. There are times when you don’t feel like playing, but you do it. It’s synonymous to preparing yourself for the grind, the marathon that’s ahead of you.”\n\nThere are still months to go before the finish line in late October — but in this marathon so far, the Cubs and the Nationals are running vastly different races.	2017-06-26 23:39:04.227935+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	6	1159	['The Washington Times Http', 'Matthew Paras']

Russian Defense Minister Sergey Lavrov said Washington was implementing a “double standard” for its counterterrorism operations in Syria, allowing groups like Jabhat Fateh al-Sham — the rebranded al Qaeda cell formerly known as Jahbat al Nusra or Nusra Front — to run roughshod over Russian-backed Assad forces on the ground in the country.\n\n“I have already said that we have the full impression, based on the experience of fighting terrorism in Syria, that the so-called Jabhat al-Nusra, or whatever it is called now, is always spared by the U.S.-led coalition forces and other states which cooperate with it,” Mr. Lavrov said during a briefing in Moscow Monday.\n\n“In recent days new evidence has emerged that Jabhat al-Nusra in its new incarnation is being dropped from the target list. We consider this an extremely dangerous game that must be stopped,” he said, according to Reuters.\n\nBreakaway or rebranded factions from the former al Qaeda Syrian cell began ground in the central part of the country starting in March, taking advantage of the regime’s increased focus on the ongoing fight against the so-called capital of the terror group known as ISIS or ISIL in Raqqa.\n\nFighters from Hay’at Tahrir Al-Sham, a faction of the former Syrian al Qaeda cell now known as Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, have overrun government forces in the central Syrian cities of Qomhana and Ma’an, 30 miles south of anti-government stronghold of Idlib, according to local reports at the time.\n\nThe attacks come as forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar Assad has begun diverting his forces from battling rebel fighters in central Syria to territory held by Islamic State, or ISIS or ISIL.\n\nDamascus has taken an increasing, unilateral role in the battle against ISIS launching strikes against the terror group’s redoubts near Deir-e-Zour and elsewhere along the central Euphrates River valley. Mr. Assad’s anti-ISIS offensive, backed by Russian firepower, is seen by regional analysts as ploy to secure as much territory for the regime once the terror group is defeated.\n\nThe ensuing vacuum has allowed al Qaeda-affiliated groups to push into rebel-held territory near Idlib and Hama.\n\nIt remains unclear how far the group’s Syrian cells will push unchecked by Damascus into rebel territory.

ST PETERSBURG, Russia, June 26 (Reuters) - The video assistant referee (VAR) technology being tested at the Confederations Cup in Russia should be refined, the head of refereeing at world soccer's governing body FIFA said on Monday.\n\n"In general we have really good results but for sure ... many aspects should be improved," Massimo Busacca told a news conference.\n\nVAR involves two video assistant referees who monitor the action on screens and draw the match referee's attention to officiating mistakes.\n\nFIFA has already said it would like to use video assistant referees at the 2018 World Cup, and soccer's law-making body IFAB is expected to decide next March whether to allow them to become part of the game on a permanent basis.\n\nBut their use has caused confusion at the Confederations Cup, especially during Sunday's match between Germany and Cameroon when on-field official Wilmar Roldan needed two reviews of an incident to send off the correct Cameroon player.\n\nCameroon coach Hugo Broos complained that he did not understand what was going on.\n\n"I have to agree, it was too long... but in the end the right player was sent off," said Busacca.\n\nThere was also controversy when a video review denied Chile a legitimate-looking goal in their 2-0 win against Cameroon on June 18, and it was used again at the end of the same match to overturn a linesman's offside call and award Chile a goal\n\nMAIN CRITICISM\n\nBut the main criticisms are the time taken to make decisions and the referees' criteria in deciding when to use the system, with some close calls being made without consulting the VARs.\n\nBusacca accepted that reviews could take the gloss off goal celebrations.\n\n"It can reduce at some moments the enjoyment of football because you have a celebration and then suddenly a review and you have to change -- so people can have to live with this," he said.\n\nIn 12 group stage matches at the Confederations Cup, video review helped correct six "game-changing decisions," Busacca said.\n\nMatch officials ruled correctly on another 29 "major incidents" with the help of the technology, he added.\n\n"It's important to mention today that clear mistakes were not missed," he said.\n\nBusacca noted that if used correctly, the system could reduce many mistakes but not eliminate them completely.

1507	Pepe lives: Cartoonist resurrecting frog hijacked by trolls			http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jun/26/pepe-lives-cartoonist-resurrecting-frog-hijacked-b/	\N	Furie and his brother, Jason, launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise $10,000 for a new comic book featuring Pepe.\nHe also has an attorney, Kimberly Motley, exploring possible litigation against those profiting off Pepe’s image without Furie’s permission.\nFurie said his plans for Pepe’s resurrection - in the first “Boy’s Club” comic book since 2010 - are top secret.\nMotley, Furie’s Milwaukee-based lawyer, said all of the characters in his comic book are copyright-protected.\nShe said she is still in “research mode” and hasn’t sued anyone yet for using Pepe’s image without permission to sell merchandise such as T-shirts, posters and hats.	Pepe the Frog is coming back from the dead.\n\nLos Angeles-based cartoonist Matt Furie told The Associated Press on Monday that he intends to resurrect the character he killed off last month in what appeared to be a rebuke to racist, anti-Semitic internet trolls who hijacked his creation, transforming it into a hate symbol.\n\nFurie and his brother, Jason, launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise $10,000 for a new comic book featuring Pepe. He also has an attorney, Kimberly Motley, exploring possible litigation against those profiting off Pepe’s image without Furie’s permission.\n\nA cartoon released in May showed Pepe in an open casket. Furie said he created that cartoon as “art therapy” shortly after November’s presidential election and nearly forgot about it.\n\nFurie said he was surprised by the wave of publicity generated by Pepe’s “death.”\n\n“It was supposed to just be a joke,” he said.\n\nThe “Save Pepe” campaign that Furie launched Monday on Kickstarter says its aim is “reclaiming his status as a universal symbol for peace, love, and acceptance.” If the campaign meets its goal, Furie said he would see that as “proof that Pepe is still a positive thing.”\n\nFurie’s “chill frog-dude” debuted in a 2006 comic book called “Boy’s Club.” Pepe’s likeness became a popular canvas for benevolent internet memes.\n\nBut the user-generated mutations became increasingly hateful and ubiquitous more than a year before the 2016 presidential election. Furie was horrified to see his creation become a mascot for the “alt-right” fringe movement, a loosely connected mix of white nationalists, neo-Nazis and other right-wing extremists.\n\n“It all just happened so fast,” he said. “Make no mistake: They’re basically the new (Ku Klux Klan).”\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League branded Pepe as a hate symbol in September 2016 and promoted Furie’s efforts to reclaim the character.\n\nFurie said his plans for Pepe’s resurrection - in the first “Boy’s Club” comic book since 2010 - are top secret.\n\n“Once we get the money together, we’re going to do it from scratch,” he said.\n\nIn the meantime, Furie said he’s also trying to “gain some entrepreneurial control” over Pepe with his attorney’s help.\n\n“It’s a very American tale, trying to control that which cannot be controlled,” he said.\n\nMotley, Furie’s Milwaukee-based lawyer, said all of the characters in his comic book are copyright-protected. She said she is still in “research mode” and hasn’t sued anyone yet for using Pepe’s image without permission to sell merchandise such as T-shirts, posters and hats.\n\n“This isn’t about crushing people’s rights to free speech,” she said. “This is about taking Pepe back to where he belongs as a positive image.”	2017-06-26 23:39:26.221057+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	6	1163	['The Washington Times Http', 'Michael Kunzelman']

AUSTIN, Texas (AP) - The NCAA is conducting an “ongoing, pending investigation” into Baylor University in the wake of a sexual assault scandal that led to the firing of football coach Art Briles and the departure of the school president, the school’s lawyers confirmed in a federal court filing.\n\nBaylor officials acknowledged the investigation while asking a judge to protect the school’s communications with the NCAA from attorneys for several women who have sued the nation's largest Baptist university.\n\nBaylor contends the school must maintain the confidentiality of the NCAA’s investigation process, though the school could turn over some information to plaintiffs’ attorneys who make specific requests. Providing all communications with the NCAA, including what documents it had requested and who had been interviewed, could compromise the investigation, Baylor’s lawyers argued.\n\nBaylor officials declined further comment Monday. New school President Linda Livingstone took her post on June 1.\n\nESPN reported in May that the NCAA had conducted interviews with Baylor officials, former employees and alleged victims, but that the school hadn’t been given a formal notice of investigation. NCAA officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press.\n\nBaylor anticipated NCAA action in May 2016 when it announced the findings of an internal investigation into sexual assaults and said that Briles had been fired and President Ken Starr, who later resigned, had been demoted. At the time, Baylor said it had hired outside counsel and contacted the NCAA about possible infractions, but did not elaborate.\n\nBaylor has been engulfed by the scandal for more than a year as more than a dozen women have filed lawsuits alleging the school or mishandled or ignored their rape claims against football players and other students for years. The school is also facing several federal civil rights investigations and a state criminal investigation.\n\nIn the same filing that seeks to withhold information about the NCAA investigation, Baylor said it also doesn’t want to share with plaintiffs’ attorneys any information that could compromise a criminal probe by the McClennan County district attorney and the Texas Rangers, the state’s elite criminal investigations unit.\n\nBaylor’s investigation, conducted by Philadelphia law firm Pepper Hamilton, found the Bears’ football program had operated as if it was “above the rules,” and that unidentified members of Briles‘ staff had improper contact with victims or witnesses and may have interfered with investigations.\n\nThe lawsuits allege several gang rapes and a “culture of violence” within the football program. Briles, who is a defendant in one of the lawsuits, has denied he tried to cover up assaults .\n\nIn a separate filing, Baylor officials told the federal judge it may compile a spreadsheet for the court of all alleged sexual assaults at Baylor since from 2003 to February 2016 to quantify the history of the problem without compromising private student information.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: http://collegefootball.ap.org and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25	2017-06-26 23:39:57.921279+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	6	1167	['The Washington Times Http', 'Jim Vertuno']

Antetokounmpo is the sixth Buck to be named to an NBA All-Defensive team and the first since Alvin Robertson was a First Team All-Defensive Team pick in 1990-91.	2017-06-26 23:40:40.778+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	6	1178	['The Washington Times Http']

The Donmar Warehouse’s film of their all-female Julius Caesar is a labour of love. Directed by Phyllida Lloyd, it’s definitely a filmed performance rather than a feature film and, as such, has to make a monumental effort to overcome the challenges of capturing live performance – which it does.\n\nLloyd, ever inventive, goes a long way towards solving these problems with a guerrilla filming style, attaching Go-Pros to members of the cast and arming them with iPhones. There’s a drone shot too, a stern birds-eye view that surveils the in-the-square Kings Cross Theatre where the performances were filmed.\n\nAlongside cameras working more traditional angles, the whole is edited into a fluent articulation of the live production, absolutely the chronicling of the project that it deserves. There’s a kind of reflexive curiosity to witnessing the onscreen audience react, but the filming style privileges the cinematic audience: we get to go where the theatre audience, fixed to their seats, never do.\n\nThe performances are calibrated for theatre rather than film, threatening to weigh things down in static sections, especially early on – but ultimately Lloyd is gifted with a great cast. Close ups change the timbre of a performance in fascinating ways: Jade Anouka’s Mark Antony is nervier, more vulnerable onscreen, you can see repressed emotions rolling across her face like thunderclouds as she bites her tongue around Clare Dunne’s Octavius. The later scenes between Harriet Walter’s Brutus and Martina Laird’s Cassius are electrifyingly great – it’s a pleasure to share such intimate space with two such fiercely smart actors.\n\nAs the plays wears on, the number of wide shots diminishes – there’s a subtle directorial hand at work that nudges you towards the thing that makes this the most touching of Julius Caesars: the broken friendships, the personal heartaches.\n\nLloyd and company lean in to more filmic language as they go along, and the bits that embrace it most work best: “Friends, Romans, Countryman” – delivered by Anouka from face down on the floor surrounded by toy guns, framed from above by the birds-eye camera – is just as exhilarating as the live version, and there are moments where an obviously theatrical metaphor (those red rubber gloves snapped on for Caesar’s assassination, for example) finds a natural harmony with the filmed medium that tantalisingly suggests more radical, expressionistic possibilities for cinema.\n\nUltimately, the film is a record, a remembrance of a project, but it also transfigures enough of the production’s chutzpah, its compassion, its keen sense of injustice, to be worth watching anew. The emotional gut-punch of the play gets through: the final moment with Walter’s angry prisoner crying for change rings delivers its message just as clearly in one medium as the other.	2017-06-26 23:41:52.896584+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	48	1202	['Rafaella Marcus', 'Thom Dibdin', 'Tim Bano']

Meet our panel: We have given our panellists pen-names and used stock images but their biographies reflect their real career details...\n\nAlbert Parker is 60 and has appeared as a regular in soaps, two BAFTA award winning sitcoms, theatre and TV Vivian Lee is 38 and has played leading roles at the National, the RSC and the Royal Court, alongside regular TV appearances Adam Lovett, 45, has appeared in Oscar-winning films, on TV and in theatre at the RSC, National Theatre, and the West End Rosemary Crackers is 50 and has worked extensively in TV, film and theatre for nearly 30 years Beryl Phoenix is in her 40s. She has played leading roles at the RSC, worked on new plays and toured both national and internationally Ros Clifford is 30. Currently a deputy stage manager, she has worked extensively in London and regional theatre for nine years Ivan Low, 47, a production manager, has worked widely in the UK and abroad with regional and national theatre, opera and dance companies\n\nBeryl ‘Story, story, story.’\n\nVivian ‘Where is the green room?’, ‘What’s the Wi-Fi code?’, ‘I’ve had 34 cups of coffee, I’m bringing in the herbals tomorrow’ followed by ‘I have a splitting headache.’\n\nAdam Marc Warren said in an interview I read that the two things actors care about the most are coffee and Wi-Fi.\n\nBeryl ‘Look after each other.’\n\nAdam ‘Are we likely to be working weekends?’\n\nRos ‘Let me ask the question’. ‘No.’ ‘For fuck’s sake.’\n\nBeryl Yes, various swear words, certainly.\n\nAlbert ‘Obviously I’m just doing this to be seen…’\n\nBeryl ‘We’re not in Aleppo, it’s only a play’.\n\nRosemary I mostly use the phrases ‘off book’ – as in ‘I have two hopes of being off book for this beast’ – ‘the fear’ – as in ‘stop mentioning when we tech, it’s giving me the fear’ – and ‘Equity dep’ – as in ‘I’m not being Equity dep, I did it last time.’\n\nIvan ‘Wang’ is popular among some technical staff. Used when, for a reason unknown, something happens in your favour that really shouldn’t. ‘That’s lighting wang!’\n\nJon In my experience, the one thing that is guaranteed on any job is that in every dressing room ever, on any night, someone will say: ‘Have we had the five?’\n\nVivian ‘I promised myself I wouldn’t start smoking again.’\n\nAlbert ‘I knew this scene in the bath.’ To which the standard director’s retort is: ‘Well, what a shame you didn’t bring the bath into the rehearsal room.’\n\nVivian ‘It’s harder when you only have one line.’\n\nIvan ‘Bespoke solutions’ is one of my golden phrases. I was asked by one director what my plan was for a mobile ladder to move around safely on a raked stage with an actor at the top of it. “Ah, that will be a bespoke solution,” says I. In reality, I hadn’t a clue how it would work. In the end it did, thankfully. Bespoke solutions. I should have the T-shirt made.\n\nJon Ah yes, what about our beloved lords and ladies, masters and mistresses? What phrases do we hear a lot from directors and what do we think of them? I cannot bear it, for example, when directors say, ‘Show me.’ And they all do say it at some point.\n\nAlbert ‘With respect...’ as your considered creative initiative is about to be totally quashed.\n\nIvan ‘Creative’. I’ve fallen foul of that word. I once discussed allocating time for the ‘creatives’ – the lighting and sound designers, choreographers and so on – to give notes over and above the director’s feedback. My colleague reminded me that the cast, crew, dressers, flymen and voice coach were all creatives and I should watch how I describe the staff. Quite correct, too.\n\nAdam Someone who worked with Emma Rice told me that when she doesn’t like what you’re doing she says: “Strong. But wrong.”\n\nAlbert That’s what the board at Shakespeare’s Globe thought, too.\n\nAdam Or when they describe the character as ‘like this’. I want to say, ‘I know what he’s like, but that doesn’t help me get there.’\n\nAlbert As I say to younger actors: just say ‘yes’, then get on with doing what you want.\n\nAdam I was in a show once that ended with a lingering look from me as I shut the door at the end of the play. The renowned director waited until the dress rehearsal before giving me the note: “Could you do it a little less as if you were taking in The Cherry Orchard for the last time?”\n\nJon While we’re on the subject of directors, what do we think of line readings? Are we for or against? They used to be so totally taboo, but some actors seem to like them now.\n\nVivian If nothing else is hitting, then I say yes.\n\nAdam I bloody love a line reading, as long as it’s a good one. But then I tend to think quite musically, so I love being told how it should sound. I think it messes up actors who don’t think that way.\n\nAlbert I usually just say: ‘Tell me how to say it and I’ll make it my own.’ That seems to work.\n\nJon Well, that’s directors sorted. How about other actors? What are the things you’re always hearing from colleagues?\n\nAlbert ‘Are you actually going to do it like that on the night?’\n\nAdam ‘If you do X here then I can do Y... and it’ll be great.’\n\nJon On my first job, an older actor told me that when a colleague says ‘Can we just have a chat about that scene?’ it saves a lot of time if you just say, ‘What do you want me to do?’\n\nAlbert ‘I think what you’re doing is fabulous. I think you should do more and more.’\n\nVivian ‘It feels like a lifetime ago since I was in.’\n\nJon ‘We haven’t done it since week one.’\n\nVivian ‘Are you off book?’\n\nJon I’m guilty of it myself, but after the first time a scene is done someone always says: ‘Well, see you at the tech.’ In fact, come to think of it, that’s another one – during the tech you’ll always hear someone say, ‘I actually like techs.’\n\nVivian I do like techs though.\n\nAdam I adore techs. All the pressure is off for a day or three.\n\nRos I can tell you exactly what actors always say to stage managers: ‘When’s tea?’ ‘When’s lunch?’ ‘Have you got a phone charger?’ ‘Can I go for a meeting?’ ‘I don’t like my prop.’ ‘I don’t like my costume.’ ‘Can you do the calls louder?'	2017-06-26 23:41:55.893139+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	48	1204	['Jon Dryden Taylor']

The Olivier-winning set and costume designer is no stranger to West End transfers, with recent hits including The 39 Steps and My Night With Reg. He tells Nick Smurthwaite why he owes it all to a certain impresario\n\nIf you conducted a poll into the most influential stage design of the last 50 years, my guess is that Sean Kenny’s set for the musical Oliver!, first seen in 1960 then revived in 1977 and again in 1983, would come out on top.\n\nMany of our top designers cite it as their childhood ‘eureka’ moment, among them Peter McKintosh, who came on a school trip from Plymouth to see Oliver! in 1977 and never looked back.\n\n“Who wouldn’t be inspired by something as extraordinary and seminal as Sean Kenny’s set? It had three revolving pieces, groundbreaking in its day, and was sheer magic to an impressionable kid,” he says. “I remember sitting there thinking, ‘That’s what I want to do.’ I don’t suppose I even knew there was such a job as a set designer.”\n\nIn fact the secondary school McKintosh attended, Plymouth College, steered him in the direction of architecture, finding his theatrical aspirations hard to fathom, and he finished up at the prestigious Bartlett School of Architecture in London.\n\n“I knew within three hours of arriving there that I was in the wrong place,” he recalls. “I lasted one term. All I did in that time was to go and see as much London theatre as possible.”\n\nOnce extricated from his architectural course, he enrolled on a theatre studies degree course at Warwick University, where he spent most of his time putting on shows with like-minded students.\n\n“I discovered Stephen Sondheim during my time there and set my heart on reviving Company. Nobody had ever heard of it but it turned out to be the most successful thing we ever did as a drama society. The whole run was packed out. Cameron Mackintosh heard about it and gave us £1,000 to bring it to the Fortune Theatre in London for one night to raise money for charity.\n\n“It changed all our lives because it was all about ambition and realising your dreams as much as it was about putting on a good show.”\n\nAfter a stint at the theatre design course attached to Bristol Old Vic School, McKintosh went on to assist top designer Mark Thompson for more than seven years, working on such landmark shows as Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat at the London Palladium, Alan Bennett’s The Wind in the Willows and The Madness of George III at the National Theatre, and Tom Stoppard’s Arcadia, also at the NT.\n\nSo busy was Thompson that he delegated more and more responsibility to McKintosh, encouraging him to progress from assistant to designer in his own right.\n\nMcKintosh’s first major solo flight was the George Stiles and Anthony Drewe musical Honk! – an adaptation of The Ugly Duckling – at the National in 1999, which won the Olivier award in 2000 for best musical. Baseball caps with yellow peaks suggested beaks while a Manchester United scarf became a turkey’s tail feathers.\n\nMcKintosh was involved in another Olivier-award winner in 2005 when he worked with director Maria Aitken and writer-performer Patrick Barlow on The 39 Steps, producing some wonderfully witty costumes and props. On Broadway it was nominated for two Tony awards.\n\n“The New York audience completely got what I’d done, which was a deceptively simple design that was actually very carefully thought out,” says McKintosh. “It was something that could only have worked on stage, just a bunch of people in a room telling a story, no bells and whistles. It lasted in one form or another for 10 years – the most wonderful experience, making people laugh all over the world.”\n\nPeter McKintosh's hit set designs 1 of 4\n\nWhenever possible, McKintosh prefers to do both sets and costumes, believing “making a whole world”, as he puts it, lends cohesion to the show’s design aesthetic.\n\nThe most recent examples of this – The Wind in the Willows at the Palladium and On the Town at Regent’s Park Open Air Theatre – presented him with very different challenges.\n\nHe says: “It was my fifth musical at the Park and the thing I love about working there is that it makes you do things you wouldn’t ever dream of doing in a more conventional pros arch theatre. It encourages you to think outside the box.”\n\nFor On the Town, about three lusty sailors on leave in 1940s New York, his challenge was to suggest a Brooklyn dockyard that could also double for the night spots where the sailors hang out. His to-do list also included a New York taxi, a full-size dinosaur skeleton and Coney Island. What sparked his over-arching idea for the set, namely a framework of deconstructed shipping containers, was a photograph by Ormond Gigli of brightly clothed models standing in the window frames of an old brownstone building in New York.\n\n“I showed the picture to Drew (McOnie, the director), who loved it, and it kind of set the tone for the look of the show, that juxtaposition between the earthy, dockside reality of the shipping containers, and the bright, bold colours of the dresses worn by the girls. Drew always said he wanted it to be a bright show. What he does so brilliantly is to take the spirit of the original and give it a contemporary twist. The way he incorporates the taxi into his choreography is an example of this.”\n\nDesigning for the Park is quite different from designing for enclosed theatres, if only because half of the show is played in daylight. “You can close everything down with lighting in a darkened auditorium,” explains McKintosh. “When you get an intimate scene between two people on a stage that is basically the size of the Coliseum, you have to be really clear about where the audience is meant to look. Focus is all important.”\n\nGiven the rave reviews for On the Town, and the award nominations that are sure to follow, did he give any consideration to a West End transfer in his deliberations? “No, I didn’t think about that at all. My only consideration was to make it work in Regent’s Park.”\n\nPeter McKintosh's designs for The Wind in the Willows 1 of 3\n\nJamie Hendry’s production of The Wind in the Willows, which started out at Theatre Royal Plymouth, the designer’s home turf, was always in line for a West End transfer. It reunited McKintosh not only with the theatre where he first cut his teeth as a scenic painter, but also with director Rachel Kavanaugh, whom he has worked with on multiple occasions.\n\nHe describes their working relationship as “symbiotic”, and, as with all the best director-designer teams, one where it is difficult to spot who has done what.\n\nQuite different from the memorable 1990 Bennett version at the National, this is very much a full-blown musical adaptation, always intended to be “big, bold and boisterous… modern-looking, funny and family friendly,” says McKintosh. “I wanted the design to reflect a sense of the beautiful, lyrical English countryside being invaded by Toad’s car, the barge, the caravan and even a train.\n\n“I was determined we weren’t going to use video because I’m not a great believer in video replacing conventional scenery. If you’re using video to represent scenery, why not use painted and built scenery? However, I do believe there is a place for imaginatively and cleverly used video that enhances scenic design. But you need to be sure to regulate it so that it is totally harmonious with the piece.”\n\nCV: Peter McKintosh\n\nBorn: Liverpool, 1967\n\nTraining: Warwick University, 1987-89; Bristol Old Vic Theatre School, 1989-90\n\nLandmark productions: Honk!, National Theatre (1999); Pericles for the Royal Shakespeare Company, London Roundhouse (2002); The 39 Steps, West End, Broadway and world tour (2005-15); The Chalk Garden, Donmar Warehouse (2008); Crazy for You, Regent’s Park Open Air Theatre and West End (2011-12); My Night With Reg, Donmar Warehouse and West End (2014-15); Our Country’s Good, National Theatre (2015); On the Town, Regent’s Park Open Air Theatre (2017); The Wind in the Willows, Theatre Royal Plymouth and London Palladium (2017)\n\nAwards: Olivier for best costume design, Crazy for You (2012)\n\nAgent: Clare Vidal-Hall\n\nThe Wind in the Willows is at the London Palladium until September 9; On the Town is at Regent’s Park Open Air Theatre until July 1	2017-06-26 23:42:01.198144+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	48	1208	['Nick Smurthwaite', 'Paul Vale']
1553	Careers Clinic: Should I go to an open audition?		https://cdn.thestage.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Careers-clinic-john-byrne.jpg	https://www.thestage.co.uk/advice/2017/careers-clinic-should-i-go-to-an-open-audition/	\N	One actor told me open castings are just advance publicity stunts and that I’m wasting my time.\nAnother has a friend who ended up in a West End show from going to an open casting just like the one I have in mind.\nJOHN BYRNE'S ADVICE It’s true that open castings have been generating press coverage since silent movie days, and that roles secured are more likely to be secondary rather than leads.\nEqually, I wouldn’t discount every open casting out of hand.\nIf the open casting is a high-profile one, I would amend the standard ‘get there early’ advice to ‘get there as early as you possibly can’.	Like all young actors, I have my wish list of people I’d like to work with and productions I’d like to be in.\n\nI’m realistic that, at this early stage of my career, the actual castings I am getting via my agent tend to be of the smaller, less glamorous kind. I’m still hoping for my ‘dream jobs’, but I accept that I probably need to build up a little more experience and profile before I can get in the frame for most of them.\n\nI’ve just heard that the producers of a big, upcoming movie will be running open castings in several cities around the country soon and, on a ‘nothing ventured, nothing gained’ basis, I’m quite keen to give that a go.\n\nI mentioned it to some of the more experienced actors in the small production I’m currently in and the response has been very mixed.\n\nOne actor told me open castings are just advance publicity stunts and that I’m wasting my time. Another has a friend who ended up in a West End show from going to an open casting just like the one I have in mind. What do you think?\n\nJOHN BYRNE'S ADVICE It’s true that open castings have been generating press coverage since silent movie days, and that roles secured are more likely to be secondary rather than leads. For this reason, it’s important to manage your expectations. Equally, I wouldn’t discount every open casting out of hand. As with most castings, they vary depending on who is running them.\n\nWhere there is a genuine job to be had, most people who make the final cut tend to have some training or previous performing experience, rather than being ‘just in off the street’.\n\nIf the open casting is a high-profile one, I would amend the standard ‘get there early’ advice to ‘get there as early as you possibly can’. If a heavily promoted casting attracts more people than can be seen on the day, there will usually be a ‘first come, first seen’ system, or at least a chance to lobby for a decent slot.\n\nAnother reason for getting there early is so that you can stay focused. Waiting lines for any audition can be off-putting environments at the best of times, given that different actors have different approaches to preparation, ranging from chatting to stressing. Add into that mix the crowds of superfans and sightseers a heavily promoted open casting tends to attract and when your own five minutes (or less) rolls around, it can be hard to block all that noise out.\n\nStanding out from the crowd has to be your aim, so any relevant special skills or talents you have are worth highlighting or, better still, demonstrating. In a normal casting situation, it may well be one of those skills that got you into the room in the first place, but with the number of CVs flying around at an open casting, just having something listed on paper or on your profile is no guarantee that it will be picked up.\n\nOnce you have done your bit and made sure they have your contact details, you have done all you can. If you don’t get called back, the chance of getting feedback beyond any you are given on the day is very slim.\n\nSo is it worth doing at all? Gather as much information as you can on the specific casting ahead of time. Is there a casting director you recognise involved? Does the casting notice resemble a regular casting brief, or does it sound more like a press release for a fun day out?\n\nIf you do decide to go, then commit fully, because it is only by giving the opportunity exactly the same amount of time and effort you would give to any other casting that you have a chance of making it worthwhile.\n\nContact careers adviser John Byrne at dearjohn@thestage.co.uk or @dearjohnbyrne	2017-06-26 23:42:02.508008+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	48	1209	['John Byrne', 'Susan Elkin']

Steve Rodgers’s 2012 play Food (receiving its first production outside Australia) is an abrasive affair, more of a haphazard buffet than a satisfying meal.\n\nIt’s clear to see how easy it would be to become hot and bothered in a kitchen with scarcely room for two people to work comfortably, bumping into each other with the movable freezer and fryer. Elma stayed behind to run their alcoholic mother’s workmen’s takeaway, while her sister Nancy went off travelling before returning to an unenthusiastic welcome.\n\nCressida Brown’s production feels stifled with so much shouting. The flashbacks of childhood neglect, eating disorders and underage sex, affectedly slipping between the first and third person are physically charged but laboured. To provide lighter relief, it tries too hard to be pally by flirting with audience members and sharing food.\n\nEmma Playfair’s performance as Elma, a good plain cook simmering with bitterness, is the highlight of the production, both sympathetic as a victim of bullying, and shocking in her cruelty as a perpetrator in the profoundly damaged sisterly relationship.\n\nMeanwhile, it’s disappointing that Nancy (Lily Newbury-Freeman), who has been objectified her entire life and perceived by her sister as a ‘blur’, is so sketchily written as to merely exist as an alluring enigma.\n\nFurthermore, the Turkish backpacker Hakan (Scott Karim) who talks his way into a kitchen porter job and provides a monologue recalling all the notches on his bedpost is a mere plot device and a distraction from what could be a compelling story of two sisters who have more than enough drama to explore.	2017-06-26 23:42:03.764254+03	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	48	1210	['Julia Rank', 'Susan Elkin']

Every month, hundreds of children enter the USA illegally. They are escaping war and poverty in their countries. This is Antonio and Alex’s story…\n\nAntonio is 15 and Alex is 11. They are brothers who fled from Guatemala, Central America. The boys say there is a lot of violence and not a lot of work in Guatemala. Antonio told us:\n\n“When people lose their jobs, they become very poor. When families don’t have jobs, the kids can’t go to school. When children’s parents die, the kids have to leave school and go to work to survive. Kids are looking after kids.”\n\nIn 2014 a surge of 69,000 children crossed the border alone. Some were going to join their parents who were already in the USA. Others had lost their parents.\n\nAntonio continues: “When we had our parents, we were very happy. We used to go out to have fun. We didn’t have to work. But my dad decided to go to the United States to work illegally, so he could send us money so we could have a better life. But then my dad died and my mum said she had to leave us for a while to find some work. We never heard from her or saw her again. We had no money. We were left with nothing. Out mother didn’t abandon us, she went to work so that we could have clothes or food. We don’t know what happened. Maybe a car hit her, maybe she’s still alive. We just don’t know. I was working in Guatemala and I would go out to look for jobs to raise money so we could pay for our escape… We had enough to get the bus to Mexico, but at the border they detained us and took us to a shelter where we were detained for fifteen days”\n\nForced back home\n\nIllegal child immigrants coming to America must prove their life is in danger or that they are orphans otherwise they are forced back home.\n\nBut – meet Stephanie. She is a lawyer and she helps “gets kids out of jail”:\n\n“The kids that I help,” she says, “have come to America fleeing violence and persecution in their home countries and they are looking to start a new life in America. Sometimes when the children cross if they don’t have any parents with them they are placed in a shelter for unaccompanied children, and are kept there until we can find a safe home for them to go to.”\n\nStephanie placed Antonio and Alex with their relatives in Colorado, USA.\n\nA better life\n\nThe authorities are investigating their story.\n\nMany Americans believe illegal immigrants are a threat. Others believe America should help them. The children themselves believe they have no choice.\n\nAlex, the younger of the two brothers tells us: “Here, I’ll have a better life.

Welcome to the FT Business school newsletter, a weekly serving of management wisdom, reading recommendations and business-related challenges. FT subscribers can sign up here to receive the newsletter by email every Monday. If you have any feedback about FT Business school, please email bschool@ft.com.\n\nAndrew Hill’s challenge\n\nWork-life balance often seems to be the holy grail of good management. But I was intrigued to learn that Glassdoor, the jobs website, has found that highly-ranked chief executives tend to have lower ratings for their companies’ work-life balance: Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs is one classic example. My hypothesis is that staff prefer successful bosses, irrespective of the benefits they provide.\n\nFor my challenge this week, I’d like to hear your innovations in work-life policies: what would you do to improve workplace satisfaction at reasonable cost? Send your ideas to bschool@ft.com.\n\nDavid Sammons rose to last week’s challenge to come up with a “nice guy” slogan for beleaguered Uber. His fine suggestion: “Moving people and goods, for good.”\n\nSince the last newsletter, Travis Kalanick has decided to step down as chief executive of the transportation company. That poses a big succession challenge to the board, which may struggle to find somebody to match the founder’s drive and commitment. For further reading, I loved this from Nicholas Carr’s blog, asking whether Uber’s next CEO should be a robot: “Let’s face it,” he writes, “Kalanick’s great failing was that he was not quite robotic enough. His flaws were not analytical but human. He was a victim of his own meat.”\n\nProfessor's picks\n\nEvery week a business school professor or academic recommends useful FT articles.\n\nGiacomo Santangelo, professor of economics at Fordham University, selects:\n\nHSBC faces fresh suit alleging forex manipulation The article mentions that ‘HSBC is facing a ... legal battle over allegations that its traders manipulated foreign exchange markets for their own profit at the expense of their clients.’ This presents an example of the ‘principal-agent problem’ — a concept not unfamiliar to any student of economics or finance. The problem arises due to misaligned interests between individuals (the principal) and the people they hire to act on their behalf (the agents).\n\nLondon riverside rents damped by flood of luxury properties This article shows how a sector can switch from a sellers’ market to a buyers’ one. A glut in luxury rental properties leads to a severe decline in rental pricing. The claim that ‘landlords are rent-takers not rent-setters’ is a fact supported by basic economic theory. In the face of already declining prices, why increase the supply of properties? This, of course, will have a benefit if the market rebounds. But that should not be expected to happen soon.\n\nEurozone economic confidence slips back from post-crisis high One thing that must be mentioned, this decrease in eurozone confidence is in line with a similar decrease in the US Consumer Confidence Index, as reported by The Conference Board. This may reflect a global trend, and not one that is specific to Europe.\n\nThe article states that ‘the European Central Bank dismissed concerns that Brexit could pose a major threat to the euro area’s economy, saying that financial firms were already adapting by relocating activities to the continent.’ I find this dismissal suspect. We do not know what Brexit's effect will be, so we cannot say that it poses no threat.\n\nJonathan Moules’ business school news\n\nSummertime and the living is easier on business school campus as the classrooms empty of full-time students, who have either graduated or are off on internships. The world may look like a hard place but some of the ongoing issues that might seem like problems, could also be seen in a more positive light.\n\nDonald Trump’s presidency has had a negative effect on US business school admissions, but has been an opportunity for Canadian schools, as I recently reflected. Moreover the travel ban on certain Muslim-dominated nations has not stemmed the tide of applications from Chinese students to masters in finance courses run in the US.\n\nThe UK’s split with the EU, negotiations for which are now well underway, has also created an opportunity for some UK schools to attract students with what look like lower fees thanks to the 16 per cent decline in the value of the pound since the referendum vote 12 months ago. It is also creating new opportunities for jobs.\n\nSummertime in Europe is also a time to think of holidays and my colleague Emma Jacobs notes in her piece this week that taking a break is not just a right but a sensible move for a healthy life. Happy holidays.\n\nAsk the academics\n\nGot a question for leading business school experts? Send it to bschool@ft.com and we will publish the best replies in future newsletters.\n\nTest your knowledge\n\nHow good is your grasp of the news?
